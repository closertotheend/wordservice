CHAPTER I

The one opened the door with a latch-key and went in, followed by a young fellow who awkwardly removed his cap.  He wore rough clothes that smacked of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which he found himself.  He did not know what to do with his cap, and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it from him.  The act was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward young fellow appreciated it.  “He understands,” was his thought.  “He’ll see me through all right.”

He walked at the other’s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his legs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea.  The wide rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric-a-brac from the low mantel.  He recoiled from side to side between the various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind.  Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed it with trepidation.  His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides.  He did not know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited vision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table, he lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano stool.  He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other men.  He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly.  The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.

“Hold on, Arthur, my boy,” he said, attempting to mask his anxiety with facetious utterance.  “This is too much all at once for yours truly.  Give me a chance to get my nerve.  You know I didn’t want to come, an’ I guess your fam’ly ain’t hankerin’ to see me neither.”

“That’s all right,” was the reassuring answer.  “You mustn’t be frightened at us.  We’re just homely people—Hello, there’s a letter for me.”

He stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to read, giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself.  And the stranger understood and appreciated.  His was the gift of sympathy, understanding; and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic process went on.  He mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with a controlled face, though in the eyes there was an expression such as wild animals betray when they fear the trap.  He was surrounded by the unknown, apprehensive of what might happen, ignorant of what he should do, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly, fearful that every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted.  He was keenly sensitive, hopelessly self-conscious, and the amused glance that the other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him like a dagger-thrust.  He saw the glance, but he gave no sign, for among the things he had learned was discipline.  Also, that dagger-thrust went to his pride.  He cursed himself for having come, and at the same time resolved that, happen what would, having come, he would carry it through.  The lines of his face hardened, and into his eyes came a fighting light.  He looked about more unconcernedly, sharply observant, every detail of the pretty interior registering itself on his brain.  His eyes were wide apart; nothing in their field of vision escaped; and as they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and a warm glow took its place.  He was responsive to beauty, and here was cause to respond.

An oil painting caught and held him.  A heavy surf thundered and burst over an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and, outside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a stormy sunset sky.  There was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly.  He forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close.  The beauty faded out of the canvas.  His face expressed his bepuzzlement.  He stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then stepped away.  Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas.  “A trick picture,” was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick.  He did not know painting.  He had been brought up on chromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or far.  He had seen oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of shops, but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near.

He glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on the table.  Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food.  An impulsive stride, with one lurch to right and left of the shoulders, brought him to the table, where he began affectionately handling the books.  He glanced at the titles and the authors’ names, read fragments of text, caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands, and, once, recognized a book he had read.  For the rest, they were strange books and strange authors.  He chanced upon a volume of Swinburne and began reading steadily, forgetful of where he was, his face glowing.  Twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the name of the author.  Swinburne! he would remember that name.  That fellow had eyes, and he had certainly seen color and flashing light.  But who was Swinburne?  Was he dead a hundred years or so, like most of the poets?  Or was he alive still, and writing?  He turned to the title-page . . . yes, he had written other books; well, he would go to the free library the first thing in the morning and try to get hold of some of Swinburne’s stuff.  He went back to the text and lost himself.  He did not notice that a young woman had entered the room.  The first he knew was when he heard Arthur’s voice saying:-

“Ruth, this is Mr. Eden.”

The book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was thrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but of her brother’s words.  Under that muscled body of his he was a mass of quivering sensibilities.  At the slightest impact of the outside world upon his consciousness, his thoughts, sympathies, and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame.  He was extraordinarily receptive and responsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever at work establishing relations of likeness and difference.  “Mr. Eden,” was what he had thrilled to—he who had been called “Eden,” or “Martin Eden,” or just “Martin,” all his life.  And “Mister!”  It was certainly going some, was his internal comment.  His mind seemed to turn, on the instant, into a vast camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around his consciousness endless pictures from his life, of stoke-holes and forecastles, camps and beaches, jails and boozing-kens, fever-hospitals and slum streets, wherein the thread of association was the fashion in which he had been addressed in those various situations.

And then he turned and saw the girl.  The phantasmagoria of his brain vanished at sight of her.  She was a pale, ethereal creature, with wide, spiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair.  He did not know how she was dressed, except that the dress was as wonderful as she.  He likened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem.  No, she was a spirit, a divinity, a goddess; such sublimated beauty was not of the earth.  Or perhaps the books were right, and there were many such as she in the upper walks of life.  She might well be sung by that chap, Swinburne.  Perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted that girl, Iseult, in the book there on the table.  All this plethora of sight, and feeling, and thought occurred on the instant.  There was no pause of the realities wherein he moved.  He saw her hand coming out to his, and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands, frankly, like a man.  The women he had known did not shake hands that way.  For that matter, most of them did not shake hands at all.  A flood of associations, visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women, rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it.  But he shook them aside and looked at her.  Never had he seen such a woman.  The women he had known!  Immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged the women he had known.  For an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait gallery, wherein she occupied the central place, while about her were limned many women, all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance, herself the unit of weight and measure.  He saw the weak and sickly faces of the girls of the factories, and the simpering, boisterous girls from the south of Market.  There were women of the cattle camps, and swarthy cigarette-smoking women of Old Mexico.  These, in turn, were crowded out by Japanese women, doll-like, stepping mincingly on wooden clogs; by Eurasians, delicate featured, stamped with degeneracy; by full-bodied South-Sea-Island women, flower-crowned and brown-skinned.  All these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare brood—frowsy, shuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel, gin-bloated hags of the stews, and all the vast hell’s following of harpies, vile-mouthed and filthy, that under the guise of monstrous female form prey upon sailors, the scrapings of the ports, the scum and slime of the human pit.

“Won’t you sit down, Mr. Eden?” the girl was saying.  “I have been looking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur told us.  It was brave of you—”

He waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at all, what he had done, and that any fellow would have done it.  She noticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions, in the process of healing, and a glance at the other loose-hanging hand showed it to be in the same condition.  Also, with quick, critical eye, she noted a scar on his cheek, another that peeped out from under the hair of the forehead, and a third that ran down and disappeared under the starched collar.  She repressed a smile at sight of the red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck.  He was evidently unused to stiff collars.  Likewise her feminine eye took in the clothes he wore, the cheap and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of the coat across the shoulders, and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles.

While he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all, he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair.  He found time to admire the ease with which she sat down, then lurched toward a chair facing her, overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was cutting.  This was a new experience for him.  All his life, up to then, he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward.  Such thoughts of self had never entered his mind.  He sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair, greatly worried by his hands.  They were in the way wherever he put them.  Arthur was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his exit with longing eyes.  He felt lost, alone there in the room with that pale spirit of a woman.  There was no bar-keeper upon whom to call for drinks, no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by means of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.

“You have such a scar on your neck, Mr. Eden,” the girl was saying.  “How did it happen?  I am sure it must have been some adventure.”

“A Mexican with a knife, miss,” he answered, moistening his parched lips and clearing hip throat.  “It was just a fight.  After I got the knife away, he tried to bite off my nose.”

Baldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot, starry night at Salina Cruz, the white strip of beach, the lights of the sugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in the distance, the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the Mexican’s face, the glint of the beast-eyes in the starlight, the sting of the steel in his neck, and the rush of blood, the crowd and the cries, the two bodies, his and the Mexican’s, locked together, rolling over and over and tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling of a guitar.  Such was the picture, and he thrilled to the memory of it, wondering if the man could paint it who had painted the pilot-schooner on the wall.  The white beach, the stars, and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great, he thought, and midway on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters.  The knife occupied a place in the picture, he decided, and would show well, with a sort of gleam, in the light of the stars.  But of all this no hint had crept into his speech.  “He tried to bite off my nose,” he concluded.

“Oh,” the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the shock in her sensitive face.

He felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on his sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks had been exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room.  Such sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for conversation with a lady.  People in the books, in her walk of life, did not talk about such things—perhaps they did not know about them, either.

There was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get started.  Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek.  Even as she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk, and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.

“It was just an accident,” he said, putting his hand to his cheek.  “One night, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main-boom-lift carried away, an’ next the tackle.  The lift was wire, an’ it was threshin’ around like a snake.  The whole watch was tryin’ to grab it, an’ I rushed in an’ got swatted.”

“Oh,” she said, this time with an accent of comprehension, though secretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering what a lift was and what swatted meant.

“This man Swineburne,” he began, attempting to put his plan into execution and pronouncing the i long.

“Who?”

“Swineburne,” he repeated, with the same mispronunciation.  “The poet.”

“Swinburne,” she corrected.

“Yes, that’s the chap,” he stammered, his cheeks hot again.  “How long since he died?”

“Why, I haven’t heard that he was dead.”  She looked at him curiously.  “Where did you make his acquaintance?”

“I never clapped eyes on him,” was the reply.  “But I read some of his poetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in.  How do you like his poetry?”

And thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had suggested.  He felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge of the chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor.  He had succeeded in making her talk her talk, and while she rattled on, he strove to follow her, marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head of hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of her face.  Follow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases and thought-processes that were foreign to his mind, but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set it tingling.  Here was intellectual life, he thought, and here was beauty, warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be.  He forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes.  Here was something to live for, to win to, to fight for—ay, and die for.  The books were true.  There were such women in the world.  She was one of them.  She lent wings to his imagination, and great, luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed vague, gigantic figures of love and romance, and of heroic deeds for woman’s sake—for a pale woman, a flower of gold.  And through the swaying, palpitant vision, as through a fairy mirage, he stared at the real woman, sitting there and talking of literature and art.  He listened as well, but he stared, unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes.  But she, who knew little of the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his burning eyes.  She had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it embarrassed her.  She stumbled and halted in her utterance.  The thread of argument slipped from her.  He frightened her, and at the same time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon.  Her training warned her of peril and of wrong, subtle, mysterious, luring; while her instincts rang clarion-voiced through her being, impelling her to hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world, to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently, was soiled and tainted by ungracious existence.  She was clean, and her cleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to learn the paradox of woman.

“As I was saying—what was I saying?”  She broke off abruptly and laughed merrily at her predicament.

“You was saying that this man Swinburne failed bein’ a great poet because—an’ that was as far as you got, miss,” he prompted, while to himself he seemed suddenly hungry, and delicious little thrills crawled up and down his spine at the sound of her laughter.  Like silver, he thought to himself, like tinkling silver bells; and on the instant, and for an instant, he was transported to a far land, where under pink cherry blossoms, he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the peaked pagoda calling straw-sandalled devotees to worship.

“Yes, thank you,” she said.  “Swinburne fails, when all is said, because he is, well, indelicate.  There are many of his poems that should never be read.  Every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful truth, and calls to all that is high and noble in the human.  Not a line of the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by that much.”

“I thought it was great,” he said hesitatingly, “the little I read.  I had no idea he was such a—a scoundrel.  I guess that crops out in his other books.”

“There are many lines that could be spared from the book you were reading,” she said, her voice primly firm and dogmatic.

“I must ’a’ missed ’em,” he announced.  “What I read was the real goods.  It was all lighted up an’ shining, an’ it shun right into me an’ lighted me up inside, like the sun or a searchlight.  That’s the way it landed on me, but I guess I ain’t up much on poetry, miss.”

He broke off lamely.  He was confused, painfully conscious of his inarticulateness.  He had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he had read, but his speech was inadequate.  He could not express what he felt, and to himself he likened himself to a sailor, in a strange ship, on a dark night, groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging.  Well, he decided, it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world.  He had never seen anything that he couldn’t get the hang of when he wanted to and it was about time for him to want to learn to talk the things that were inside of him so that she could understand.  She was bulking large on his horizon.

“Now Longfellow—” she was saying.

“Yes, I’ve read ’m,” he broke in impulsively, spurred on to exhibit and make the most of his little store of book knowledge, desirous of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod.  “‘The Psalm of Life,’ ‘Excelsior,’ an’ . . . I guess that’s all.”

She nodded her head and smiled, and he felt, somehow, that her smile was tolerant, pitifully tolerant.  He was a fool to attempt to make a pretence that way.  That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry.

“Excuse me, miss, for buttin’ in that way.  I guess the real facts is that I don’t know nothin’ much about such things.  It ain’t in my class.  But I’m goin’ to make it in my class.”

It sounded like a threat.  His voice was determined, his eyes were flashing, the lines of his face had grown harsh.  And to her it seemed that the angle of his jaw had changed; its pitch had become unpleasantly aggressive.  At the same time a wave of intense virility seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her.

“I think you could make it in—in your class,” she finished with a laugh.  “You are very strong.”

Her gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck, heavy corded, almost bull-like, bronzed by the sun, spilling over with rugged health and strength.  And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt drawn to him.  She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her mind.  It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her.  She was shocked by this thought.  It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature.  Besides, strength to her was a gross and brutish thing.  Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender gracefulness.  Yet the thought still persisted.  It bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck.  In truth, she was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for strength.  But she did not know it.  She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had, who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar.

“Yes, I ain’t no invalid,” he said.  “When it comes down to hard-pan, I can digest scrap-iron.  But just now I’ve got dyspepsia.  Most of what you was sayin’ I can’t digest.  Never trained that way, you see.  I like books and poetry, and what time I’ve had I’ve read ’em, but I’ve never thought about ’em the way you have.  That’s why I can’t talk about ’em.  I’m like a navigator adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass.  Now I want to get my bearin’s.  Mebbe you can put me right.  How did you learn all this you’ve ben talkin’?”

“By going to school, I fancy, and by studying,” she answered.

“I went to school when I was a kid,” he began to object.

“Yes; but I mean high school, and lectures, and the university.”

“You’ve gone to the university?” he demanded in frank amazement.  He felt that she had become remoter from him by at least a million miles.

“I’m going there now.  I’m taking special courses in English.”

He did not know what “English” meant, but he made a mental note of that item of ignorance and passed on.

“How long would I have to study before I could go to the university?” he asked.

She beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge, and said: “That depends upon how much studying you have already done.  You have never attended high school?  Of course not.  But did you finish grammar school?”

“I had two years to run, when I left,” he answered.  “But I was always honorably promoted at school.”

The next moment, angry with himself for the boast, he had gripped the arms of the chair so savagely that every finger-end was stinging.  At the same moment he became aware that a woman was entering the room.  He saw the girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the newcomer.  They kissed each other, and, with arms around each other’s waists, they advanced toward him.  That must be her mother, he thought.  She was a tall, blond woman, slender, and stately, and beautiful.  Her gown was what he might expect in such a house.  His eyes delighted in the graceful lines of it.  She and her dress together reminded him of women on the stage.  Then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and gowns entering the London theatres while he stood and watched and the policemen shoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning.  Next his mind leaped to the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, where, too, from the sidewalk, he had seen grand ladies.  Then the city and the harbor of Yokohama, in a thousand pictures, began flashing before his eyes.  But he swiftly dismissed the kaleidoscope of memory, oppressed by the urgent need of the present.  He knew that he must stand up to be introduced, and he struggled painfully to his feet, where he stood with trousers bagging at the knees, his arms loose-hanging and ludicrous, his face set hard for the impending ordeal.

CHAPTER II

The process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him.  Between halts and stumbles, jerks and lurches, locomotion had at times seemed impossible.  But at last he had made it, and was seated alongside of Her.  The array of knives and forks frightened him.  They bristled with unknown perils, and he gazed at them, fascinated, till their dazzle became a background across which moved a succession of forecastle pictures, wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef with sheath-knives and fingers, or scooping thick pea-soup out of pannikins by means of battered iron spoons.  The stench of bad beef was in his nostrils, while in his ears, to the accompaniment of creaking timbers and groaning bulkheads, echoed the loud mouth-noises of the eaters.  He watched them eating, and decided that they ate like pigs.  Well, he would be careful here.  He would make no noise.  He would keep his mind upon it all the time.

He glanced around the table.  Opposite him was Arthur, and Arthur’s brother, Norman.  They were her brothers, he reminded himself, and his heart warmed toward them.  How they loved each other, the members of this family!  There flashed into his mind the picture of her mother, of the kiss of greeting, and of the pair of them walking toward him with arms entwined.  Not in his world were such displays of affection between parents and children made.  It was a revelation of the heights of existence that were attained in the world above.  It was the finest thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world.  He was moved deeply by appreciation of it, and his heart was melting with sympathetic tenderness.  He had starved for love all his life.  His nature craved love.  It was an organic demand of his being.  Yet he had gone without, and hardened himself in the process.  He had not known that he needed love.  Nor did he know it now.  He merely saw it in operation, and thrilled to it, and thought it fine, and high, and splendid.

He was glad that Mr. Morse was not there.  It was difficult enough getting acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother, Norman.  Arthur he already knew somewhat.  The father would have been too much for him, he felt sure.  It seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life.  The severest toil was child’s play compared with this.  Tiny nodules of moisture stood out on his forehead, and his shirt was wet with sweat from the exertion of doing so many unaccustomed things at once.  He had to eat as he had never eaten before, to handle strange tools, to glance surreptitiously about and learn how to accomplish each new thing, to receive the flood of impressions that was pouring in upon him and being mentally annotated and classified; to be conscious of a yearning for her that perturbed him in the form of a dull, aching restlessness; to feel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod, and to have his mind ever and again straying off in speculation and vague plans of how to reach to her.  Also, when his secret glance went across to Norman opposite him, or to any one else, to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion, that person’s features were seized upon by his mind, which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what they were—all in relation to her.  Then he had to talk, to hear what was said to him and what was said back and forth, and to answer, when it was necessary, with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required a constant curb.  And to add confusion to confusion, there was the servant, an unceasing menace, that appeared noiselessly at his shoulder, a dire Sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums demanding instantaneous solution.  He was oppressed throughout the meal by the thought of finger-bowls.  Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of times, he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like.  He had heard of such things, and now, sooner or later, somewhere in the next few minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings who used them—ay, and he would use them himself.  And most important of all, far down and yet always at the surface of his thought, was the problem of how he should comport himself toward these persons.  What should his attitude be?  He wrestled continually and anxiously with the problem.  There were cowardly suggestions that he should make believe, assume a part; and there were still more cowardly suggestions that warned him he would fail in such course, that his nature was not fitted to live up to it, and that he would make a fool of himself.

It was during the first part of the dinner, struggling to decide upon his attitude, that he was very quiet.  He did not know that his quietness was giving the lie to Arthur’s words of the day before, when that brother of hers had announced that he was going to bring a wild man home to dinner and for them not to be alarmed, because they would find him an interesting wild man.  Martin Eden could not have found it in him, just then, to believe that her brother could be guilty of such treachery—especially when he had been the means of getting this particular brother out of an unpleasant row.  So he sat at table, perturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that went on about him.  For the first time he realized that eating was something more than a utilitarian function.  He was unaware of what he ate.  It was merely food.  He was feasting his love of beauty at this table where eating was an aesthetic function.  It was an intellectual function, too.  His mind was stirred.  He heard words spoken that were meaningless to him, and other words that he had seen only in books and that no man or woman he had known was of large enough mental caliber to pronounce.  When he heard such words dropping carelessly from the lips of the members of this marvellous family, her family, he thrilled with delight.  The romance, and beauty, and high vigor of the books were coming true.  He was in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees his dreams stalk out from the crannies of fantasy and become fact.

Never had he been at such an altitude of living, and he kept himself in the background, listening, observing, and pleasuring, replying in reticent monosyllables, saying, “Yes, miss,” and “No, miss,” to her, and “Yes, ma’am,” and “No, ma’am,” to her mother.  He curbed the impulse, arising out of his sea-training, to say “Yes, sir,” and “No, sir,” to her brothers.  He felt that it would be inappropriate and a confession of inferiority on his part—which would never do if he was to win to her.  Also, it was a dictate of his pride.  “By God!” he cried to himself, once; “I’m just as good as them, and if they do know lots that I don’t, I could learn ’m a few myself, all the same!”  And the next moment, when she or her mother addressed him as “Mr. Eden,” his aggressive pride was forgotten, and he was glowing and warm with delight.  He was a civilized man, that was what he was, shoulder to shoulder, at dinner, with people he had read about in books.  He was in the books himself, adventuring through the printed pages of bound volumes.

But while he belied Arthur’s description, and appeared a gentle lamb rather than a wild man, he was racking his brains for a course of action.  He was no gentle lamb, and the part of second fiddle would never do for the high-pitched dominance of his nature.  He talked only when he had to, and then his speech was like his walk to the table, filled with jerks and halts as he groped in his polyglot vocabulary for words, debating over words he knew were fit but which he feared he could not pronounce, rejecting other words he knew would not be understood or would be raw and harsh.  But all the time he was oppressed by the consciousness that this carefulness of diction was making a booby of him, preventing him from expressing what he had in him.  Also, his love of freedom chafed against the restriction in much the same way his neck chafed against the starched fetter of a collar.  Besides, he was confident that he could not keep it up.  He was by nature powerful of thought and sensibility, and the creative spirit was restive and urgent.  He was swiftly mastered by the concept or sensation in him that struggled in birth-throes to receive expression and form, and then he forgot himself and where he was, and the old words—the tools of speech he knew—slipped out.

Once, he declined something from the servant who interrupted and pestered at his shoulder, and he said, shortly and emphatically, “Pew!”

On the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant, the servant was smugly pleased, and he was wallowing in mortification.  But he recovered himself quickly.

“It’s the Kanaka for ‘finish,’” he explained, “and it just come out naturally.  It’s spelt p-a-u.”

He caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands, and, being in explanatory mood, he said:-

“I just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers.  She was behind time, an’ around the Puget Sound ports we worked like niggers, storing cargo-mixed freight, if you know what that means.  That’s how the skin got knocked off.”

“Oh, it wasn’t that,” she hastened to explain, in turn.  “Your hands seemed too small for your body.”

His cheeks were hot.  He took it as an exposure of another of his deficiencies.

“Yes,” he said depreciatingly.  “They ain’t big enough to stand the strain.  I can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders.  They are too strong, an’ when I smash a man on the jaw the hands get smashed, too.”

He was not happy at what he had said.  He was filled with disgust at himself.  He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things that were not nice.

“It was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did—and you a stranger,” she said tactfully, aware of his discomfiture though not of the reason for it.

He, in turn, realized what she had done, and in the consequent warm surge of gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his loose-worded tongue.

“It wasn’t nothin’ at all,” he said.  “Any guy ’ud do it for another.  That bunch of hoodlums was lookin’ for trouble, an’ Arthur wasn’t botherin’ ’em none.  They butted in on ’m, an’ then I butted in on them an’ poked a few.  That’s where some of the skin off my hands went, along with some of the teeth of the gang.  I wouldn’t ’a’ missed it for anything.  When I seen—”

He paused, open-mouthed, on the verge of the pit of his own depravity and utter worthlessness to breathe the same air she did.  And while Arthur took up the tale, for the twentieth time, of his adventure with the drunken hoodlums on the ferry-boat and of how Martin Eden had rushed in and rescued him, that individual, with frowning brows, meditated upon the fool he had made of himself, and wrestled more determinedly with the problem of how he should conduct himself toward these people.  He certainly had not succeeded so far.  He wasn’t of their tribe, and he couldn’t talk their lingo, was the way he put it to himself.  He couldn’t fake being their kind.  The masquerade would fail, and besides, masquerade was foreign to his nature.  There was no room in him for sham or artifice.  Whatever happened, he must be real.  He couldn’t talk their talk just yet, though in time he would.  Upon that he was resolved.  But in the meantime, talk he must, and it must be his own talk, toned down, of course, so as to be comprehensible to them and so as not to shook them too much.  And furthermore, he wouldn’t claim, not even by tacit acceptance, to be familiar with anything that was unfamiliar.  In pursuance of this decision, when the two brothers, talking university shop, had used “trig” several times, Martin Eden demanded:-

“What is trig?”

“Trignometry,” Norman said; “a higher form of math.”

“And what is math?” was the next question, which, somehow, brought the laugh on Norman.

“Mathematics, arithmetic,” was the answer.

Martin Eden nodded.  He had caught a glimpse of the apparently illimitable vistas of knowledge.  What he saw took on tangibility.  His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.  In the alchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics and the whole field of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much landscape.  The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest glades, all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights.  In the distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze, but behind this purple haze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the lure of romance.  It was like wine to him.  Here was adventure, something to do with head and hand, a world to conquer—and straightway from the back of his consciousness rushed the thought, conquering, to win to her, that lily-pale spirit sitting beside him.

The glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur, who, all evening, had been trying to draw his wild man out.  Martin Eden remembered his decision.  For the first time he became himself, consciously and deliberately at first, but soon lost in the joy of creating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners’ eyes.  He had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner Halcyon when she was captured by a revenue cutter.  He saw with wide eyes, and he could tell what he saw.  He brought the pulsing sea before them, and the men and the ships upon the sea.  He communicated his power of vision, till they saw with his eyes what he had seen.  He selected from the vast mass of detail with an artist’s touch, drawing pictures of life that glowed and burned with light and color, injecting movement so that his listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough eloquence, enthusiasm, and power.  At times he shocked them with the vividness of the narrative and his terms of speech, but beauty always followed fast upon the heels of violence, and tragedy was relieved by humor, by interpretations of the strange twists and quirks of sailors’ minds.

And while he talked, the girl looked at him with startled eyes.  His fire warmed her.  She wondered if she had been cold all her days.  She wanted to lean toward this burning, blazing man that was like a volcano spouting forth strength, robustness, and health.  She felt that she must lean toward him, and resisted by an effort.  Then, too, there was the counter impulse to shrink away from him.  She was repelled by those lacerated hands, grimed by toil so that the very dirt of life was ingrained in the flesh itself, by that red chafe of the collar and those bulging muscles.  His roughness frightened her; each roughness of speech was an insult to her ear, each rough phase of his life an insult to her soul.  And ever and again would come the draw of him, till she thought he must be evil to have such power over her.  All that was most firmly established in her mind was rocking.  His romance and adventure were battering at the conventions.  Before his facile perils and ready laugh, life was no longer an affair of serious effort and restraint, but a toy, to be played with and turned topsy-turvy, carelessly to be lived and pleasured in, and carelessly to be flung aside.  “Therefore, play!” was the cry that rang through her.  “Lean toward him, if so you will, and place your two hands upon his neck!”  She wanted to cry out at the recklessness of the thought, and in vain she appraised her own cleanness and culture and balanced all that she was against what he was not.  She glanced about her and saw the others gazing at him with rapt attention; and she would have despaired had not she seen horror in her mother’s eyes—fascinated horror, it was true, but none the less horror.  This man from outer darkness was evil.  Her mother saw it, and her mother was right.  She would trust her mother’s judgment in this as she had always trusted it in all things.  The fire of him was no longer warm, and the fear of him was no longer poignant.

Later, at the piano, she played for him, and at him, aggressively, with the vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that separated them.  Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his head; and though it stunned him and crushed him down, it incited him.  He gazed upon her in awe.  In his mind, as in her own, the gulf widened; but faster than it widened, towered his ambition to win across it.  But he was too complicated a plexus of sensibilities to sit staring at a gulf a whole evening, especially when there was music.  He was remarkably susceptible to music.  It was like strong drink, firing him to audacities of feeling,—a drug that laid hold of his imagination and went cloud-soaring through the sky.  It banished sordid fact, flooded his mind with beauty, loosed romance and to its heels added wings.  He did not understand the music she played.  It was different from the dance-hall piano-banging and blatant brass bands he had heard.  But he had caught hints of such music from the books, and he accepted her playing largely on faith, patiently waiting, at first, for the lifting measures of pronounced and simple rhythm, puzzled because those measures were not long continued.  Just as he caught the swing of them and started, his imagination attuned in flight, always they vanished away in a chaotic scramble of sounds that was meaningless to him, and that dropped his imagination, an inert weight, back to earth.

Once, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all this.  He caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the message that her hands pronounced upon the keys.  Then he dismissed the thought as unworthy and impossible, and yielded himself more freely to the music.  The old delightful condition began to be induced.  His feet were no longer clay, and his flesh became spirit; before his eyes and behind his eyes shone a great glory; and then the scene before him vanished and he was away, rocking over the world that was to him a very dear world.  The known and the unknown were commingled in the dream-pageant that thronged his vision.  He entered strange ports of sun-washed lands, and trod market-places among barbaric peoples that no man had ever seen.  The scent of the spice islands was in his nostrils as he had known it on warm, breathless nights at sea, or he beat up against the southeast trades through long tropic days, sinking palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead.  Swift as thought the pictures came and went.  One instant he was astride a broncho and flying through the fairy-colored Painted Desert country; the next instant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited sepulchre of Death Valley, or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean where great ice islands towered and glistened in the sun.  He lay on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellow-sounding surf.  The hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires, in the light of which danced the hula dancers to the barbaric love-calls of the singers, who chanted to tinkling ukuleles and rumbling tom-toms.  It was a sensuous, tropic night.  In the background a volcano crater was silhouetted against the stars.  Overhead drifted a pale crescent moon, and the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.

He was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his consciousness was the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that poured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams.  He did not merely feel.  Sensation invested itself in form and color and radiance, and what his imagination dared, it objectified in some sublimated and magic way.  Past, present, and future mingled; and he went on oscillating across the broad, warm world, through high adventure and noble deeds to Her—ay, and with her, winning her, his arm about her, and carrying her on in flight through the empery of his mind.

And she, glancing at him across her shoulder, saw something of all this in his face.  It was a transfigured face, with great shining eyes that gazed beyond the veil of sound and saw behind it the leap and pulse of life and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit.  She was startled.  The raw, stumbling lout was gone.  The ill-fitting clothes, battered hands, and sunburned face remained; but these seemed the prison-bars through which she saw a great soul looking forth, inarticulate and dumb because of those feeble lips that would not give it speech.  Only for a flashing moment did she see this, then she saw the lout returned, and she laughed at the whim of her fancy.  But the impression of that fleeting glimpse lingered, and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling retreat and go, she lent him the volume of Swinburne, and another of Browning—she was studying Browning in one of her English courses.  He seemed such a boy, as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks, that a wave of pity, maternal in its prompting, welled up in her.  She did not remember the lout, nor the imprisoned soul, nor the man who had stared at her in all masculineness and delighted and frightened her.  She saw before her only a boy, who was shaking her hand with a hand so calloused that it felt like a nutmeg-grater and rasped her skin, and who was saying jerkily:-

“The greatest time of my life.  You see, I ain’t used to things. . . ”  He looked about him helplessly.  “To people and houses like this.  It’s all new to me, and I like it.”

“I hope you’ll call again,” she said, as he was saying good night to her brothers.

He pulled on his cap, lurched desperately through the doorway, and was gone.

“Well, what do you think of him?” Arthur demanded.

“He is most interesting, a whiff of ozone,” she answered.  “How old is he?”

“Twenty—almost twenty-one.  I asked him this afternoon.  I didn’t think he was that young.”

And I am three years older, was the thought in her mind as she kissed her brothers goodnight.

CHAPTER III

As Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat pocket.  It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican tobacco, which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette.  He drew the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long and lingering exhalation.  “By God!” he said aloud, in a voice of awe and wonder.  “By God!” he repeated.  And yet again he murmured, “By God!”  Then his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and stuffed into his pocket.  A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his head to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid unconcern.  He was only dimly aware that it was raining.  He was in an ecstasy, dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.

He had met the woman at last—the woman that he had thought little about, not being given to thinking about women, but whom he had expected, in a remote way, he would sometime meet.  He had sat next to her at table.  He had felt her hand in his, he had looked into her eyes and caught a vision of a beautiful spirit;—but no more beautiful than the eyes through which it shone, nor than the flesh that gave it expression and form.  He did not think of her flesh as flesh,—which was new to him; for of the women he had known that was the only way he thought.  Her flesh was somehow different.  He did not conceive of her body as a body, subject to the ills and frailties of bodies.  Her body was more than the garb of her spirit.  It was an emanation of her spirit, a pure and gracious crystallization of her divine essence.  This feeling of the divine startled him.  It shocked him from his dreams to sober thought.  No word, no clew, no hint, of the divine had ever reached him before.  He had never believed in the divine.  He had always been irreligious, scoffing good-naturedly at the sky-pilots and their immortality of the soul.  There was no life beyond, he had contended; it was here and now, then darkness everlasting.  But what he had seen in her eyes was soul—immortal soul that could never die.  No man he had known, nor any woman, had given him the message of immortality.  But she had.  She had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him.  Her face shimmered before his eyes as he walked along,—pale and serious, sweet and sensitive, smiling with pity and tenderness as only a spirit could smile, and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be.  Her purity smote him like a blow.  It startled him.  He had known good and bad; but purity, as an attribute of existence, had never entered his mind.  And now, in her, he conceived purity to be the superlative of goodness and of cleanness, the sum of which constituted eternal life.

And promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life.  He was not fit to carry water for her—he knew that; it was a miracle of luck and a fantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and talk with her that night.  It was accidental.  There was no merit in it.  He did not deserve such fortune.  His mood was essentially religious.  He was humble and meek, filled with self-disparagement and abasement.  In such frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form.  He was convicted of sin.  But as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid glimpses of their future lordly existence, so did he catch similar glimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing her.  But this possession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from possession as he had known it.  Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself climbing the heights with her, sharing thoughts with her, pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her.  It was a soul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought.  He did not think it.  For that matter, he did not think at all.  Sensation usurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had never known, drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling itself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of life.

He staggered along like a drunken man, murmuring fervently aloud: “By God!  By God!”

A policeman on a street corner eyed him suspiciously, then noted his sailor roll.

“Where did you get it?” the policeman demanded.

Martin Eden came back to earth.  His was a fluid organism, swiftly adjustable, capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and crannies.  With the policeman’s hail he was immediately his ordinary self, grasping the situation clearly.

“It’s a beaut, ain’t it?” he laughed back.  “I didn’t know I was talkin’ out loud.”

“You’ll be singing next,” was the policeman’s diagnosis.

“No, I won’t.  Gimme a match an’ I’ll catch the next car home.”

He lighted his cigarette, said good night, and went on.  “Now wouldn’t that rattle you?” he ejaculated under his breath.  “That copper thought I was drunk.”  He smiled to himself and meditated.  “I guess I was,” he added; “but I didn’t think a woman’s face’d do it.”

He caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley.  It was crowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and again barking out college yells.  He studied them curiously.  They were university boys.  They went to the same university that she did, were in her class socially, could know her, could see her every day if they wanted to.  He wondered that they did not want to, that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her that evening, talking with her, sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle.  His thoughts wandered on.  He noticed one with narrow-slitted eyes and a loose-lipped mouth.  That fellow was vicious, he decided.  On shipboard he would be a sneak, a whiner, a tattler.  He, Martin Eden, was a better man than that fellow.  The thought cheered him.  It seemed to draw him nearer to Her.  He began comparing himself with the students.  He grew conscious of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that he was physically their master.  But their heads were filled with knowledge that enabled them to talk her talk,—the thought depressed him.  But what was a brain for? he demanded passionately.  What they had done, he could do.  They had been studying about life from the books while he had been busy living life.  His brain was just as full of knowledge as theirs, though it was a different kind of knowledge.  How many of them could tie a lanyard knot, or take a wheel or a lookout?  His life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and daring, hardship and toil.  He remembered his failures and scrapes in the process of learning.  He was that much to the good, anyway.  Later on they would have to begin living life and going through the mill as he had gone.  Very well.  While they were busy with that, he could be learning the other side of life from the books.

As the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated Oakland from Berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story building along the front of which ran the proud sign, HIGGINBOTHAM’S CASH STORE.  Martin Eden got off at this corner.  He stared up for a moment at the sign.  It carried a message to him beyond its mere wording.  A personality of smallness and egotism and petty underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves.  Bernard Higginbotham had married his sister, and he knew him well.  He let himself in with a latch-key and climbed the stairs to the second floor.  Here lived his brother-in-law.  The grocery was below.  There was a smell of stale vegetables in the air.  As he groped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy-cart, left there by one of his numerous nephews and nieces, and brought up against a door with a resounding bang.  “The pincher,” was his thought; “too miserly to burn two cents’ worth of gas and save his boarders’ necks.”

He fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room, where sat his sister and Bernard Higginbotham.  She was patching a pair of his trousers, while his lean body was distributed over two chairs, his feet dangling in dilapidated carpet-slippers over the edge of the second chair.  He glanced across the top of the paper he was reading, showing a pair of dark, insincere, sharp-staring eyes.  Martin Eden never looked at him without experiencing a sense of repulsion.  What his sister had seen in the man was beyond him.  The other affected him as so much vermin, and always aroused in him an impulse to crush him under his foot.  “Some day I’ll beat the face off of him,” was the way he often consoled himself for enduring the man’s existence.  The eyes, weasel-like and cruel, were looking at him complainingly.

“Well,” Martin demanded.  “Out with it.”

“I had that door painted only last week,” Mr. Higginbotham half whined, half bullied; “and you know what union wages are.  You should be more careful.”

Martin had intended to reply, but he was struck by the hopelessness of it.  He gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo on the wall.  It surprised him.  He had always liked it, but it seemed that now he was seeing it for the first time.  It was cheap, that was what it was, like everything else in this house.  His mind went back to the house he had just left, and he saw, first, the paintings, and next, Her, looking at him with melting sweetness as she shook his hand at leaving.  He forgot where he was and Bernard Higginbotham’s existence, till that gentleman demanded:-

“Seen a ghost?”

Martin came back and looked at the beady eyes, sneering, truculent, cowardly, and there leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same eyes when their owner was making a sale in the store below—subservient eyes, smug, and oily, and flattering.

“Yes,” Martin answered.  “I seen a ghost.  Good night.  Good night, Gertrude.”

He started to leave the room, tripping over a loose seam in the slatternly carpet.

“Don’t bang the door,” Mr. Higginbotham cautioned him.

He felt the blood crawl in his veins, but controlled himself and closed the door softly behind him.

Mr. Higginbotham looked at his wife exultantly.

“He’s ben drinkin’,” he proclaimed in a hoarse whisper.  “I told you he would.”

She nodded her head resignedly.

“His eyes was pretty shiny,” she confessed; “and he didn’t have no collar, though he went away with one.  But mebbe he didn’t have more’n a couple of glasses.”

“He couldn’t stand up straight,” asserted her husband.  “I watched him.  He couldn’t walk across the floor without stumblin’.  You heard ’m yourself almost fall down in the hall.”

“I think it was over Alice’s cart,” she said.  “He couldn’t see it in the dark.”

Mr. Higginbotham’s voice and wrath began to rise.  All day he effaced himself in the store, reserving for the evening, with his family, the privilege of being himself.

“I tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk.”

His voice was cold, sharp, and final, his lips stamping the enunciation of each word like the die of a machine.  His wife sighed and remained silent.  She was a large, stout woman, always dressed slatternly and always tired from the burdens of her flesh, her work, and her husband.

“He’s got it in him, I tell you, from his father,” Mr. Higginbotham went on accusingly.  “An’ he’ll croak in the gutter the same way.  You know that.”

She nodded, sighed, and went on stitching.  They were agreed that Martin had come home drunk.  They did not have it in their souls to know beauty, or they would have known that those shining eyes and that glowing face betokened youth’s first vision of love.

“Settin’ a fine example to the children,” Mr. Higginbotham snorted, suddenly, in the silence for which his wife was responsible and which he resented.  Sometimes he almost wished she would oppose him more.  “If he does it again, he’s got to get out.  Understand!  I won’t put up with his shinanigan—debotchin’ innocent children with his boozing.”  Mr. Higginbotham liked the word, which was a new one in his vocabulary, recently gleaned from a newspaper column.  “That’s what it is, debotchin’—there ain’t no other name for it.”

Still his wife sighed, shook her head sorrowfully, and stitched on.  Mr. Higginbotham resumed the newspaper.

“Has he paid last week’s board?” he shot across the top of the newspaper.

She nodded, then added, “He still has some money.”

“When is he goin’ to sea again?”

“When his pay-day’s spent, I guess,” she answered.  “He was over to San Francisco yesterday looking for a ship.  But he’s got money, yet, an’ he’s particular about the kind of ship he signs for.”

“It’s not for a deck-swab like him to put on airs,” Mr. Higginbotham snorted.  “Particular!  Him!”

“He said something about a schooner that’s gettin’ ready to go off to some outlandish place to look for buried treasure, that he’d sail on her if his money held out.”

“If he only wanted to steady down, I’d give him a job drivin’ the wagon,” her husband said, but with no trace of benevolence in his voice.  “Tom’s quit.”

His wife looked alarm and interrogation.

“Quit to-night.  Is goin’ to work for Carruthers.  They paid ’m more’n I could afford.”

“I told you you’d lose ’m,” she cried out.  “He was worth more’n you was giving him.”

“Now look here, old woman,” Higginbotham bullied, “for the thousandth time I’ve told you to keep your nose out of the business.  I won’t tell you again.”

“I don’t care,” she sniffled.  “Tom was a good boy.”  Her husband glared at her.  This was unqualified defiance.

“If that brother of yours was worth his salt, he could take the wagon,” he snorted.

“He pays his board, just the same,” was the retort.  “An’ he’s my brother, an’ so long as he don’t owe you money you’ve got no right to be jumping on him all the time.  I’ve got some feelings, if I have been married to you for seven years.”

“Did you tell ’m you’d charge him for gas if he goes on readin’ in bed?” he demanded.

Mrs. Higginbotham made no reply.  Her revolt faded away, her spirit wilting down into her tired flesh.  Her husband was triumphant.  He had her.  His eyes snapped vindictively, while his ears joyed in the sniffles she emitted.  He extracted great happiness from squelching her, and she squelched easily these days, though it had been different in the first years of their married life, before the brood of children and his incessant nagging had sapped her energy.

“Well, you tell ’m to-morrow, that’s all,” he said.  “An’ I just want to tell you, before I forget it, that you’d better send for Marian to-morrow to take care of the children.  With Tom quit, I’ll have to be out on the wagon, an’ you can make up your mind to it to be down below waitin’ on the counter.”

“But to-morrow’s wash day,” she objected weakly.

“Get up early, then, an’ do it first.  I won’t start out till ten o’clock.”

He crinkled the paper viciously and resumed his reading.

CHAPTER IV

Martin Eden, with blood still crawling from contact with his brother-in-law, felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered his room, a tiny cubbyhole with space for a bed, a wash-stand, and one chair.  Mr. Higginbotham was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife could do the work.  Besides, the servant’s room enabled them to take in two boarders instead of one.  Martin placed the Swinburne and Browning on the chair, took off his coat, and sat down on the bed.  A screeching of asthmatic springs greeted the weight of his body, but he did not notice them.  He started to take off his shoes, but fell to staring at the white plaster wall opposite him, broken by long streaks of dirty brown where rain had leaked through the roof.  On this befouled background visions began to flow and burn.  He forgot his shoes and stared long, till his lips began to move and he murmured, “Ruth.”

“Ruth.”  He had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful.  It delighted his ear, and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it.  “Ruth.”  It was a talisman, a magic word to conjure with.  Each time he murmured it, her face shimmered before him, suffusing the foul wall with a golden radiance.  This radiance did not stop at the wall.  It extended on into infinity, and through its golden depths his soul went questing after hers.  The best that was in him was out in splendid flood.  The very thought of her ennobled and purified him, made him better, and made him want to be better.  This was new to him.  He had never known women who had made him better.  They had always had the counter effect of making him beastly.  He did not know that many of them had done their best, bad as it was.  Never having been conscious of himself, he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love from women and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his youth.  Though they had often bothered him, he had never bothered about them; and he would never have dreamed that there were women who had been better because of him.  Always in sublime carelessness had he lived, till now, and now it seemed to him that they had always reached out and dragged at him with vile hands.  This was not just to them, nor to himself.  But he, who for the first time was becoming conscious of himself, was in no condition to judge, and he burned with shame as he stared at the vision of his infamy.

He got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking-glass over the wash-stand.  He passed a towel over it and looked again, long and carefully.  It was the first time he had ever really seen himself.  His eyes were made for seeing, but up to that moment they had been filled with the ever changing panorama of the world, at which he had been too busy gazing, ever to gaze at himself.  He saw the head and face of a young fellow of twenty, but, being unused to such appraisement, he did not know how to value it.  Above a square-domed forehead he saw a mop of brown hair, nut-brown, with a wave to it and hints of curls that were a delight to any woman, making hands tingle to stroke it and fingers tingle to pass caresses through it.  But he passed it by as without merit, in Her eyes, and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the high, square forehead,—striving to penetrate it and learn the quality of its content.  What kind of a brain lay behind there? was his insistent interrogation.  What was it capable of?  How far would it take him?  Would it take him to her?

He wondered if there was soul in those steel-gray eyes that were often quite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the sun-washed deep.  He wondered, also, how his eyes looked to her.  He tried to imagine himself she, gazing into those eyes of his, but failed in the jugglery.  He could successfully put himself inside other men’s minds, but they had to be men whose ways of life he knew.  He did not know her way of life.  She was wonder and mystery, and how could he guess one thought of hers?  Well, they were honest eyes, he concluded, and in them was neither smallness nor meanness.  The brown sunburn of his face surprised him.  He had not dreamed he was so black.  He rolled up his shirt-sleeve and compared the white underside if the arm with his face.  Yes, he was a white man, after all.  But the arms were sunburned, too.  He twisted his arm, rolled the biceps over with his other hand, and gazed underneath where he was least touched by the sun.  It was very white.  He laughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the thought that it was once as white as the underside of his arm; nor did he dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who could boast fairer or smoother skins than he—fairer than where he had escaped the ravages of the sun.

His might have been a cherub’s mouth, had not the full, sensuous lips a trick, under stress, of drawing firmly across the teeth.  At times, so tightly did they draw, the mouth became stern and harsh, even ascetic.  They were the lips of a fighter and of a lover.  They could taste the sweetness of life with relish, and they could put the sweetness aside and command life.  The chin and jaw, strong and just hinting of square aggressiveness, helped the lips to command life.  Strength balanced sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect, compelling him to love beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were wholesome.  And between the lips were teeth that had never known nor needed the dentist’s care.  They were white and strong and regular, he decided, as he looked at them.  But as he looked, he began to be troubled.  Somewhere, stored away in the recesses of his mind and vaguely remembered, was the impression that there were people who washed their teeth every day.  They were the people from up above—people in her class.  She must wash her teeth every day, too.  What would she think if she learned that he had never washed his teeth in all the days of his life?  He resolved to get a tooth-brush and form the habit.  He would begin at once, to-morrow.  It was not by mere achievement that he could hope to win to her.  He must make a personal reform in all things, even to tooth-washing and neck-gear, though a starched collar affected him as a renunciation of freedom.

He held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused palm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and which no brush could scrub away.  How different was her palm!  He thrilled deliciously at the remembrance.  Like a rose-petal, he thought; cool and soft as a snowflake.  He had never thought that a mere woman’s hand could be so sweetly soft.  He caught himself imagining the wonder of a caress from such a hand, and flushed guiltily.  It was too gross a thought for her.  In ways it seemed to impugn her high spirituality.  She was a pale, slender spirit, exalted far beyond the flesh; but nevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts.  He was used to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women.  Well he knew why their hands were rough; but this hand of hers . . . It was soft because she had never used it to work with.  The gulf yawned between her and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have to work for a living.  He suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who did not labor.  It towered before him on the wall, a figure in brass, arrogant and powerful.  He had worked himself; his first memories seemed connected with work, and all his family had worked.  There was Gertrude.  When her hands were not hard from the endless housework, they were swollen and red like boiled beef, what of the washing.  And there was his sister Marian.  She had worked in the cannery the preceding summer, and her slim, pretty hands were all scarred with the tomato-knives.  Besides, the tips of two of her fingers had been left in the cutting machine at the paper-box factory the preceding winter.  He remembered the hard palms of his mother as she lay in her coffin.  And his father had worked to the last fading gasp; the horned growth on his hands must have been half an inch thick when he died.  But Her hands were soft, and her mother’s hands, and her brothers’.  This last came to him as a surprise; it was tremendously indicative of the highness of their caste, of the enormous distance that stretched between her and him.

He sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off his shoes.  He was a fool; he had been made drunken by a woman’s face and by a woman’s soft, white hands.  And then, suddenly, before his eyes, on the foul plaster-wall appeared a vision.  He stood in front of a gloomy tenement house.  It was night-time, in the East End of London, and before him stood Margey, a little factory girl of fifteen.  He had seen her home after the bean-feast.  She lived in that gloomy tenement, a place not fit for swine.  His hand was going out to hers as he said good night.  She had put her lips up to be kissed, but he wasn’t going to kiss her.  Somehow he was afraid of her.  And then her hand closed on his and pressed feverishly.  He felt her callouses grind and grate on his, and a great wave of pity welled over him.  He saw her yearning, hungry eyes, and her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his arms about her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips.  Her glad little cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a cat.  Poor little starveling!  He continued to stare at the vision of what had happened in the long ago.  His flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to him, and his heart was warm with pity.  It was a gray scene, greasy gray, and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones.  And then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and up through the other vision, displacing it, glimmered Her pale face under its crown of golden hair, remote and inaccessible as a star.

He took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed them.  Just the same, she told me to call again, he thought.  He took another look at himself in the glass, and said aloud, with great solemnity:-

“Martin Eden, the first thing to-morrow you go to the free library an’ read up on etiquette.  Understand!”

He turned off the gas, and the springs shrieked under his body.

“But you’ve got to quit cussin’, Martin, old boy; you’ve got to quit cussin’,” he said aloud.

Then he dozed off to sleep and to dream dreams that for madness and audacity rivalled those of poppy-eaters.

CHAPTER V

He awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere that smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes, and that was vibrant with the jar and jangle of tormented life.  As he came out of his room he heard the slosh of water, a sharp exclamation, and a resounding smack as his sister visited her irritation upon one of her numerous progeny.  The squall of the child went through him like a knife.  He was aware that the whole thing, the very air he breathed, was repulsive and mean.  How different, he thought, from the atmosphere of beauty and repose of the house wherein Ruth dwelt.  There it was all spiritual.  Here it was all material, and meanly material.

“Come here, Alfred,” he called to the crying child, at the same time thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket, where he carried his money loose in the same large way that he lived life in general.  He put a quarter in the youngster’s hand and held him in his arms a moment, soothing his sobs.  “Now run along and get some candy, and don’t forget to give some to your brothers and sisters.  Be sure and get the kind that lasts longest.”

His sister lifted a flushed face from the wash-tub and looked at him.

“A nickel’d ha’ ben enough,” she said.  “It’s just like you, no idea of the value of money.  The child’ll eat himself sick.”

“That’s all right, sis,” he answered jovially.  “My money’ll take care of itself.  If you weren’t so busy, I’d kiss you good morning.”

He wanted to be affectionate to this sister, who was good, and who, in her way, he knew, loved him.  But, somehow, she grew less herself as the years went by, and more and more baffling.  It was the hard work, the many children, and the nagging of her husband, he decided, that had changed her.  It came to him, in a flash of fancy, that her nature seemed taking on the attributes of stale vegetables, smelly soapsuds, and of the greasy dimes, nickels, and quarters she took in over the counter of the store.

“Go along an’ get your breakfast,” she said roughly, though secretly pleased.  Of all her wandering brood of brothers he had always been her favorite.  “I declare I will kiss you,” she said, with a sudden stir at her heart.

With thumb and forefinger she swept the dripping suds first from one arm and then from the other.  He put his arms round her massive waist and kissed her wet steamy lips. The tears welled into her eyes—not so much from strength of feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork.  She shoved him away from her, but not before he caught a glimpse of her moist eyes.

“You’ll find breakfast in the oven,” she said hurriedly.  “Jim ought to be up now.  I had to get up early for the washing.  Now get along with you and get out of the house early.  It won’t be nice to-day, what of Tom quittin’ an’ nobody but Bernard to drive the wagon.”

Martin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart, the image of her red face and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain.  She might love him if she only had some time, he concluded.  But she was worked to death.  Bernard Higginbotham was a brute to work her so hard.  But he could not help but feel, on the other hand, that there had not been anything beautiful in that kiss.  It was true, it was an unusual kiss.  For years she had kissed him only when he returned from voyages or departed on voyages. But this kiss had tasted soapsuds, and the lips, he had noticed, were flabby.  There had been no quick, vigorous lip-pressure such as should accompany any kiss.  Hers was the kiss of a tired woman who had been tired so long that she had forgotten how to kiss.  He remembered her as a girl, before her marriage, when she would dance with the best, all night, after a hard day’s work at the laundry, and think nothing of leaving the dance to go to another day’s hard work.  And then he thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her lips as it resided in all about her.  Her kiss would be like her hand-shake or the way she looked at one, firm and frank.  In imagination he dared to think of her lips on his, and so vividly did he imagine that he went dizzy at the thought and seemed to rift through clouds of rose-petals, filling his brain with their perfume.

In the kitchen he found Jim, the other boarder, eating mush very languidly, with a sick, far-away look in his eyes.  Jim was a plumber’s apprentice whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament, coupled with a certain nervous stupidity, promised to take him nowhere in the race for bread and butter.

“Why don’t you eat?” he demanded, as Martin dipped dolefully into the cold, half-cooked oatmeal mush.  “Was you drunk again last night?”

Martin shook his head.  He was oppressed by the utter squalidness of it all.  Ruth Morse seemed farther removed than ever.

“I was,” Jim went on with a boastful, nervous giggle.  “I was loaded right to the neck.  Oh, she was a daisy.  Billy brought me home.”

Martin nodded that he heard,—it was a habit of nature with him to pay heed to whoever talked to him,—and poured a cup of lukewarm coffee.

“Goin’ to the Lotus Club dance to-night?” Jim demanded.  “They’re goin’ to have beer, an’ if that Temescal bunch comes, there’ll be a rough-house.  I don’t care, though.  I’m takin’ my lady friend just the same.  Cripes, but I’ve got a taste in my mouth!”

He made a wry face and attempted to wash the taste away with coffee.

“D’ye know Julia?”

Martin shook his head.

“She’s my lady friend,” Jim explained, “and she’s a peach.  I’d introduce you to her, only you’d win her.  I don’t see what the girls see in you, honest I don’t; but the way you win them away from the fellers is sickenin’.”

“I never got any away from you,” Martin answered uninterestedly.  The breakfast had to be got through somehow.

“Yes, you did, too,” the other asserted warmly.  “There was Maggie.”

“Never had anything to do with her.  Never danced with her except that one night.”

“Yes, an’ that’s just what did it,” Jim cried out.  “You just danced with her an’ looked at her, an’ it was all off.  Of course you didn’t mean nothin’ by it, but it settled me for keeps.  Wouldn’t look at me again.  Always askin’ about you.  She’d have made fast dates enough with you if you’d wanted to.”

“But I didn’t want to.”

“Wasn’t necessary.  I was left at the pole.”  Jim looked at him admiringly.  “How d’ye do it, anyway, Mart?”

“By not carin’ about ’em,” was the answer.

“You mean makin’ b’lieve you don’t care about them?” Jim queried eagerly.

Martin considered for a moment, then answered, “Perhaps that will do, but with me I guess it’s different.  I never have cared—much.  If you can put it on, it’s all right, most likely.”

“You should ’a’ ben up at Riley’s barn last night,” Jim announced inconsequently.  “A lot of the fellers put on the gloves.  There was a peach from West Oakland.  They called ’m ‘The Rat.’  Slick as silk.  No one could touch ’m.  We was all wishin’ you was there.  Where was you anyway?”

“Down in Oakland,” Martin replied.

“To the show?”

Martin shoved his plate away and got up.

“Comin’ to the dance to-night?” the other called after him.

“No, I think not,” he answered.

He went downstairs and out into the street, breathing great breaths of air.  He had been suffocating in that atmosphere, while the apprentice’s chatter had driven him frantic.  There had been times when it was all he could do to refrain from reaching over and mopping Jim’s face in the mush-plate.  The more he had chattered, the more remote had Ruth seemed to him.  How could he, herding with such cattle, ever become worthy of her?  He was appalled at the problem confronting him, weighted down by the incubus of his working-class station.  Everything reached out to hold him down—his sister, his sister’s house and family, Jim the apprentice, everybody he knew, every tie of life.  Existence did not taste good in his mouth.  Up to then he had accepted existence, as he had lived it with all about him, as a good thing.  He had never questioned it, except when he read books; but then, they were only books, fairy stories of a fairer and impossible world.  But now he had seen that world, possible and real, with a flower of a woman called Ruth in the midmost centre of it; and thenceforth he must know bitter tastes, and longings sharp as pain, and hopelessness that tantalized because it fed on hope.

He had debated between the Berkeley Free Library and the Oakland Free Library, and decided upon the latter because Ruth lived in Oakland.  Who could tell?—a library was a most likely place for her, and he might see her there.  He did not know the way of libraries, and he wandered through endless rows of fiction, till the delicate-featured French-looking girl who seemed in charge, told him that the reference department was upstairs.  He did not know enough to ask the man at the desk, and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove.  He had heard of book philosophy, but had not imagined there had been so much written about it.  The high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at the same time stimulated him.  Here was work for the vigor of his brain.  He found books on trigonometry in the mathematics section, and ran the pages, and stared at the meaningless formulas and figures.  He could read English, but he saw there an alien speech.  Norman and Arthur knew that speech.  He had heard them talking it.  And they were her brothers.  He left the alcove in despair.  From every side the books seemed to press upon him and crush him.

He had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big.  He was frightened.  How could his brain ever master it all?  Later, he remembered that there were other men, many men, who had mastered it; and he breathed a great oath, passionately, under his breath, swearing that his brain could do what theirs had done.

And so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he stared at the shelves packed with wisdom.  In one miscellaneous section he came upon a “Norrie’s Epitome.”  He turned the pages reverently.  In a way, it spoke a kindred speech.  Both he and it were of the sea.  Then he found a “Bowditch” and books by Lecky and Marshall.  There it was; he would teach himself navigation.  He would quit drinking, work up, and become a captain.  Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment.  As a captain, he could marry her (if she would have him).  And if she wouldn’t, well—he would live a good life among men, because of Her, and he would quit drinking anyway.  Then he remembered the underwriters and the owners, the two masters a captain must serve, either of which could and would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed.  He cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books.  No; no more of the sea for him.  There was power in all that wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do them on the land.  Besides, captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them.

Noon came, and afternoon.  He forgot to eat, and sought on for the books on etiquette; for, in addition to career, his mind was vexed by a simple and very concrete problem: When you meet a young lady and she asks you to call, how soon can you call? was the way he worded it to himself.  But when he found the right shelf, he sought vainly for the answer.  He was appalled at the vast edifice of etiquette, and lost himself in the mazes of visiting-card conduct between persons in polite society.  He abandoned his search.  He had not found what he wanted, though he had found that it would take all of a man’s time to be polite, and that he would have to live a preliminary life in which to learn how to be polite.

“Did you find what you wanted?” the man at the desk asked him as he was leaving.

“Yes, sir,” he answered.  “You have a fine library here.”

The man nodded.  “We should be glad to see you here often.  Are you a sailor?”

“Yes, sir,” he answered.  “And I’ll come again.”

Now, how did he know that? he asked himself as he went down the stairs.

And for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and straight and awkwardly, until he forgot himself in his thoughts, whereupon his rolling gait gracefully returned to him.

CHAPTER VI

A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden.  He was famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped his life with a giant’s grasp.  He could not steel himself to call upon her.  He was afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an awful breach of that awful thing called etiquette.  He spent long hours in the Oakland and Berkeley libraries, and made out application blanks for membership for himself, his sisters Gertrude and Marian, and Jim, the latter’s consent being obtained at the expense of several glasses of beer.  With four cards permitting him to draw books, he burned the gas late in the servant’s room, and was charged fifty cents a week for it by Mr. Higginbotham.

The many books he read but served to whet his unrest.  Every page of every book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge.  His hunger fed upon what he read, and increased.  Also, he did not know where to begin, and continually suffered from lack of preparation.  The commonest references, that he could see plainly every reader was expected to know, he did not know.  And the same was true of the poetry he read which maddened him with delight.  He read more of Swinburne than was contained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and “Dolores” he understood thoroughly.  But surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded.  How could she, living the refined life she did?  Then he chanced upon Kipling’s poems, and was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour with which familiar things had been invested.  He was amazed at the man’s sympathy with life and at his incisive psychology.  Psychology was a new word in Martin’s vocabulary.  He had bought a dictionary, which deed had decreased his supply of money and brought nearer the day on which he must sail in search of more.  Also, it incensed Mr. Higginbotham, who would have preferred the money taking the form of board.

He dared not go near Ruth’s neighborhood in the daytime, but night found him lurking like a thief around the Morse home, stealing glimpses at the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her.  Several times he barely escaped being caught by her brothers, and once he trailed Mr. Morse down town and studied his face in the lighted streets, longing all the while for some quick danger of death to threaten so that he might spring in and save her father.  On another night, his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a second-story window.  He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror.  It was only for a moment, but it was a long moment to him, during which his blood turned to wine and sang through his veins.  Then she pulled down the shade.  But it was her room—he had learned that; and thereafter he strayed there often, hiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of the street and smoking countless cigarettes.  One afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a bank, and received another proof of the enormous distance that separated Ruth from him.  She was of the class that dealt with banks.  He had never been inside a bank in his life, and he had an idea that such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very powerful.

In one way, he had undergone a moral revolution.  Her cleanness and purity had reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need to be clean.  He must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the same air with her.  He washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands with a kitchen scrub-brush till he saw a nail-brush in a drug-store window and divined its use.  While purchasing it, the clerk glanced at his nails, suggested a nail-file, and so he became possessed of an additional toilet-tool.  He ran across a book in the library on the care of the body, and promptly developed a penchant for a cold-water bath every morning, much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr. Higginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high-fangled notions and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra for the water.  Another stride was in the direction of creased trousers.  Now that Martin was aroused in such matters, he swiftly noted the difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working class and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men above the working class.  Also, he learned the reason why, and invaded his sister’s kitchen in search of irons and ironing-board.  He had misadventures at first, hopelessly burning one pair and buying another, which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must put to sea.

But the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance.  He still smoked, but he drank no more.  Up to that time, drinking had seemed to him the proper thing for men to do, and he had prided himself on his strong head which enabled him to drink most men under the table.  Whenever he encountered a chance shipmate, and there were many in San Francisco, he treated them and was treated in turn, as of old, but he ordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and good-naturedly endured their chaffing.  And as they waxed maudlin he studied them, watching the beast rise and master them and thanking God that he was no longer as they.  They had their limitations to forget, and when they were drunk, their dim, stupid spirits were even as gods, and each ruled in his heaven of intoxicated desire.  With Martin the need for strong drink had vanished.  He was drunken in new and more profound ways—with Ruth, who had fired him with love and with a glimpse of higher and eternal life; with books, that had set a myriad maggots of desire gnawing in his brain; and with the sense of personal cleanliness he was achieving, that gave him even more superb health than what he had enjoyed and that made his whole body sing with physical well-being.

One night he went to the theatre, on the blind chance that he might see her there, and from the second balcony he did see her.  He saw her come down the aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with a football mop of hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant apprehension and jealousy.  He saw her take her seat in the orchestra circle, and little else than her did he see that night—a pair of slender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with distance.  But there were others who saw, and now and again, glancing at those about him, he noted two young girls who looked back from the row in front, a dozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes.  He had always been easy-going.  It was not in his nature to give rebuff.  In the old days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged smiling.  But now it was different.  He did smile back, then looked away, and looked no more deliberately.  But several times, forgetting the existence of the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles.  He could not re-thumb himself in a day, nor could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature; so, at such moments, he smiled at the girls in warm human friendliness.  It was nothing new to him.  He knew they were reaching out their woman’s hands to him.  But it was different now.  Far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world, so different, so terrifically different, from these two girls of his class, that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow.  He had it in his heart to wish that they could possess, in some small measure, her goodness and glory.  And not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching.  He was not flattered by it; he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it.  He knew, did he belong in Ruth’s class, that there would be no overtures from these girls; and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down.

He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent on seeing Her as she passed out.  There were always numbers of men who stood on the sidewalk outside, and he could pull his cap down over his eyes and screen himself behind some one’s shoulder so that she should not see him.  He emerged from the theatre with the first of the crowd; but scarcely had he taken his position on the edge of the sidewalk when the two girls appeared.  They were looking for him, he knew; and for the moment he could have cursed that in him which drew women.  Their casual edging across the sidewalk to the curb, as they drew near, apprised him of discovery.  They slowed down, and were in the thick of the crown as they came up with him.  One of them brushed against him and apparently for the first time noticed him.  She was a slender, dark girl, with black, defiant eyes.  But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.

“Hello,” he said.

It was automatic; he had said it so often before under similar circumstances of first meetings.  Besides, he could do no less.  There was that large tolerance and sympathy in his nature that would permit him to do no less.  The black-eyed girl smiled gratification and greeting, and showed signs of stopping, while her companion, arm linked in arm, giggled and likewise showed signs of halting.  He thought quickly.  It would never do for Her to come out and see him talking there with them.  Quite naturally, as a matter of course, he swung in along-side the dark-eyed one and walked with her.  There was no awkwardness on his part, no numb tongue.  He was at home here, and he held his own royally in the badinage, bristling with slang and sharpness, that was always the preliminary to getting acquainted in these swift-moving affairs.  At the corner where the main stream of people flowed onward, he started to edge out into the cross street.  But the girl with the black eyes caught his arm, following him and dragging her companion after her, as she cried:

“Hold on, Bill!  What’s yer rush?  You’re not goin’ to shake us so sudden as all that?”

He halted with a laugh, and turned, facing them.  Across their shoulders he could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps.  Where he stood it was not so light, and, unseen, he would be able to see Her as she passed by.  She would certainly pass by, for that way led home.

“What’s her name?” he asked of the giggling girl, nodding at the dark-eyed one.

“You ask her,” was the convulsed response.

“Well, what is it?” he demanded, turning squarely on the girl in question.

“You ain’t told me yours, yet,” she retorted.

“You never asked it,” he smiled.  “Besides, you guessed the first rattle.  It’s Bill, all right, all right.”

“Aw, go ’long with you.”  She looked him in the eyes, her own sharply passionate and inviting.  “What is it, honest?”

Again she looked.  All the centuries of woman since sex began were eloquent in her eyes.  And he measured her in a careless way, and knew, bold now, that she would begin to retreat, coyly and delicately, as he pursued, ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted.  And, too, he was human, and could feel the draw of her, while his ego could not but appreciate the flattery of her kindness.  Oh, he knew it all, and knew them well, from A to Z.  Good, as goodness might be measured in their particular class, hard-working for meagre wages and scorning the sale of self for easier ways, nervously desirous for some small pinch of happiness in the desert of existence, and facing a future that was a gamble between the ugliness of unending toil and the black pit of more terrible wretchedness, the way whereto being briefer though better paid.

“Bill,” he answered, nodding his head.  “Sure, Pete, Bill an’ no other.”

“No joshin’?” she queried.

“It ain’t Bill at all,” the other broke in.

“How do you know?” he demanded.  “You never laid eyes on me before.”

“No need to, to know you’re lyin’,” was the retort.

“Straight, Bill, what is it?” the first girl asked.

“Bill’ll do,” he confessed.

She reached out to his arm and shook him playfully.  “I knew you was lyin’, but you look good to me just the same.”

He captured the hand that invited, and felt on the palm familiar markings and distortions.

“When’d you chuck the cannery?” he asked.

“How’d yeh know?” and, “My, ain’t cheh a mind-reader!” the girls chorussed.

And while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them, before his inner sight towered the book-shelves of the library, filled with the wisdom of the ages.  He smiled bitterly at the incongruity of it, and was assailed by doubts.  But between inner vision and outward pleasantry he found time to watch the theatre crowd streaming by.  And then he saw Her, under the lights, between her brother and the strange young man with glasses, and his heart seemed to stand still.  He had waited long for this moment.  He had time to note the light, fluffy something that hid her queenly head, the tasteful lines of her wrapped figure, the gracefulness of her carriage and of the hand that caught up her skirts; and then she was gone and he was left staring at the two girls of the cannery, at their tawdry attempts at prettiness of dress, their tragic efforts to be clean and trim, the cheap cloth, the cheap ribbons, and the cheap rings on the fingers.  He felt a tug at his arm, and heard a voice saying:-

“Wake up, Bill!  What’s the matter with you?”

“What was you sayin’?” he asked.

“Oh, nothin’,” the dark girl answered, with a toss of her head.  “I was only remarkin’—”

“What?”

“Well, I was whisperin’ it’d be a good idea if you could dig up a gentleman friend—for her” (indicating her companion), “and then, we could go off an’ have ice-cream soda somewhere, or coffee, or anything.”

He was afflicted by a sudden spiritual nausea.  The transition from Ruth to this had been too abrupt.  Ranged side by side with the bold, defiant eyes of the girl before him, he saw Ruth’s clear, luminous eyes, like a saint’s, gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity.  And, somehow, he felt within him a stir of power.  He was better than this.  Life meant more to him than it meant to these two girls whose thoughts did not go beyond ice-cream and a gentleman friend.  He remembered that he had led always a secret life in his thoughts.  These thoughts he had tried to share, but never had he found a woman capable of understanding—nor a man.  He had tried, at times, but had only puzzled his listeners.  And as his thoughts had been beyond them, so, he argued now, he must be beyond them.  He felt power move in him, and clenched his fists.  If life meant more to him, then it was for him to demand more from life, but he could not demand it from such companionship as this.  Those bold black eyes had nothing to offer.  He knew the thoughts behind them—of ice-cream and of something else.  But those saint’s eyes alongside—they offered all he knew and more than he could guess.  They offered books and painting, beauty and repose, and all the fine elegance of higher existence.  Behind those black eyes he knew every thought process.  It was like clockwork.  He could watch every wheel go around.  Their bid was low pleasure, narrow as the grave, that palled, and the grave was at the end of it.  But the bid of the saint’s eyes was mystery, and wonder unthinkable, and eternal life.  He had caught glimpses of the soul in them, and glimpses of his own soul, too.

“There’s only one thing wrong with the programme,” he said aloud.  “I’ve got a date already.”

The girl’s eyes blazed her disappointment.

“To sit up with a sick friend, I suppose?” she sneered.

“No, a real, honest date with—” he faltered, “with a girl.”

“You’re not stringin’ me?” she asked earnestly.

He looked her in the eyes and answered: “It’s straight, all right.  But why can’t we meet some other time?  You ain’t told me your name yet.  An’ where d’ye live?”

“Lizzie,” she replied, softening toward him, her hand pressing his arm, while her body leaned against his.  “Lizzie Connolly.  And I live at Fifth an’ Market.”

He talked on a few minutes before saying good night.  He did not go home immediately; and under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up at a window and murmured: “That date was with you, Ruth.  I kept it for you.”

CHAPTER VII

A week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth Morse, and still he dared not call.  Time and again he nerved himself up to call, but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died away.  He did not know the proper time to call, nor was there any one to tell him, and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable blunder.  Having shaken himself free from his old companions and old ways of life, and having no new companions, nothing remained for him but to read, and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined a dozen pairs of ordinary eyes.  But his eyes were strong, and they were backed by a body superbly strong.  Furthermore, his mind was fallow.  It had lain fallow all his life so far as the abstract thought of the books was concerned, and it was ripe for the sowing.  It had never been jaded by study, and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth that would not let go.

It seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries, so far behind were the old life and outlook.  But he was baffled by lack of preparation.  He attempted to read books that required years of preliminary specialization.  One day he would read a book of antiquated philosophy, and the next day one that was ultra-modern, so that his head would be whirling with the conflict and contradiction of ideas.  It was the same with the economists.  On the one shelf at the library he found Karl Marx, Ricardo, Adam Smith, and Mill, and the abstruse formulas of the one gave no clew that the ideas of another were obsolete.  He was bewildered, and yet he wanted to know.  He had become interested, in a day, in economics, industry, and politics.  Passing through the City Hall Park, he had noticed a group of men, in the centre of which were half a dozen, with flushed faces and raised voices, earnestly carrying on a discussion.  He joined the listeners, and heard a new, alien tongue in the mouths of the philosophers of the people.  One was a tramp, another was a labor agitator, a third was a law-school student, and the remainder was composed of wordy workingmen.  For the first time he heard of socialism, anarchism, and single tax, and learned that there were warring social philosophies.  He heard hundreds of technical words that were new to him, belonging to fields of thought that his meagre reading had never touched upon.  Because of this he could not follow the arguments closely, and he could only guess at and surmise the ideas wrapped up in such strange expressions.  Then there was a black-eyed restaurant waiter who was a theosophist, a union baker who was an agnostic, an old man who baffled all of them with the strange philosophy that what is is right, and another old man who discoursed interminably about the cosmos and the father-atom and the mother-atom.

Martin Eden’s head was in a state of addlement when he went away after several hours, and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions of a dozen unusual words.  And when he left the library, he carried under his arm four volumes: Madam Blavatsky’s “Secret Doctrine,” “Progress and Poverty,” “The Quintessence of Socialism,” and, “Warfare of Religion and Science.”  Unfortunately, he began on the “Secret Doctrine.”  Every line bristled with many-syllabled words he did not understand.  He sat up in bed, and the dictionary was in front of him more often than the book.  He looked up so many new words that when they recurred, he had forgotten their meaning and had to look them up again.  He devised the plan of writing the definitions in a note-book, and filled page after page with them.  And still he could not understand.  He read until three in the morning, and his brain was in a turmoil, but not one essential thought in the text had he grasped.  He looked up, and it seemed that the room was lifting, heeling, and plunging like a ship upon the sea.  Then he hurled the “Secret Doctrine” and many curses across the room, turned off the gas, and composed himself to sleep.  Nor did he have much better luck with the other three books.  It was not that his brain was weak or incapable; it could think these thoughts were it not for lack of training in thinking and lack of the thought-tools with which to think.  He guessed this, and for a while entertained the idea of reading nothing but the dictionary until he had mastered every word in it.

Poetry, however, was his solace, and he read much of it, finding his greatest joy in the simpler poets, who were more understandable.  He loved beauty, and there he found beauty.  Poetry, like music, stirred him profoundly, and, though he did not know it, he was preparing his mind for the heavier work that was to come.  The pages of his mind were blank, and, without effort, much he read and liked, stanza by stanza, was impressed upon those pages, so that he was soon able to extract great joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music and the beauty of the printed words he had read.  Then he stumbled upon Gayley’s “Classic Myths” and Bulfinch’s “Age of Fable,” side by side on a library shelf.  It was illumination, a great light in the darkness of his ignorance, and he read poetry more avidly than ever.

The man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often that he had become quite cordial, always greeting him with a smile and a nod when he entered.  It was because of this that Martin did a daring thing.  Drawing out some books at the desk, and while the man was stamping the cards, Martin blurted out:-

“Say, there’s something I’d like to ask you.”

The man smiled and paid attention.

“When you meet a young lady an’ she asks you to call, how soon can you call?”

Martin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders, what of the sweat of the effort.

“Why I’d say any time,” the man answered.

“Yes, but this is different,” Martin objected.  “She—I—well, you see, it’s this way: maybe she won’t be there.  She goes to the university.”

“Then call again.”

“What I said ain’t what I meant,” Martin confessed falteringly, while he made up his mind to throw himself wholly upon the other’s mercy.  “I’m just a rough sort of a fellow, an’ I ain’t never seen anything of society.  This girl is all that I ain’t, an’ I ain’t anything that she is.  You don’t think I’m playin’ the fool, do you?” he demanded abruptly.

“No, no; not at all, I assure you,” the other protested.  “Your request is not exactly in the scope of the reference department, but I shall be only too pleased to assist you.”

Martin looked at him admiringly.

“If I could tear it off that way, I’d be all right,” he said.

“I beg pardon?”

“I mean if I could talk easy that way, an’ polite, an’ all the rest.”

“Oh,” said the other, with comprehension.

“What is the best time to call?  The afternoon?—not too close to meal-time?  Or the evening?  Or Sunday?”

“I’ll tell you,” the librarian said with a brightening face.  “You call her up on the telephone and find out.”

“I’ll do it,” he said, picking up his books and starting away.

He turned back and asked:-

“When you’re speakin’ to a young lady—say, for instance, Miss Lizzie Smith—do you say ‘Miss Lizzie’? or ‘Miss Smith’?”

“Say ‘Miss Smith,’” the librarian stated authoritatively.  “Say ‘Miss Smith’ always—until you come to know her better.”

So it was that Martin Eden solved the problem.

“Come down any time; I’ll be at home all afternoon,” was Ruth’s reply over the telephone to his stammered request as to when he could return the borrowed books.

She met him at the door herself, and her woman’s eyes took in immediately the creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable change in him for the better.  Also, she was struck by his face.  It was almost violent, this health of his, and it seemed to rush out of him and at her in waves of force.  She felt the urge again of the desire to lean toward him for warmth, and marvelled again at the effect his presence produced upon her.  And he, in turn, knew again the swimming sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand in greeting.  The difference between them lay in that she was cool and self-possessed while his face flushed to the roots of the hair.  He stumbled with his old awkwardness after her, and his shoulders swung and lurched perilously.

Once they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on easily—more easily by far than he had expected.  She made it easy for him; and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever.  They talked first of the borrowed books, of the Swinburne he was devoted to, and of the Browning he did not understand; and she led the conversation on from subject to subject, while she pondered the problem of how she could be of help to him.  She had thought of this often since their first meeting.  She wanted to help him.  He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever made before, and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal in her.  Her pity could not be of the common sort, when the man who drew it was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind and pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings.  The old fascination of his neck was there, and there was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it.  It seemed still a wanton impulse, but she had grown more used to it.  She did not dream that in such guise new-born love would epitomize itself.  Nor did she dream that the feeling he excited in her was love.  She thought she was merely interested in him as an unusual type possessing various potential excellencies, and she even felt philanthropic about it.

She did not know she desired him; but with him it was different.  He knew that he loved her, and he desired her as he had never before desired anything in his life.  He had loved poetry for beauty’s sake; but since he met her the gates to the vast field of love-poetry had been opened wide.  She had given him understanding even more than Bulfinch and Gayley.  There was a line that a week before he would not have favored with a second thought—“God’s own mad lover dying on a kiss”; but now it was ever insistent in his mind.  He marvelled at the wonder of it and the truth; and as he gazed upon her he knew that he could die gladly upon a kiss.  He felt himself God’s own mad lover, and no accolade of knighthood could have given him greater pride.  And at last he knew the meaning of life and why he had been born.

As he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring.  He reviewed all the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door, and longed for it again.  His gaze wandered often toward her lips, and he yearned for them hungrily.  But there was nothing gross or earthly about this yearning.  It gave him exquisite delight to watch every movement and play of those lips as they enunciated the words she spoke; yet they were not ordinary lips such as all men and women had.  Their substance was not mere human clay.  They were lips of pure spirit, and his desire for them seemed absolutely different from the desire that had led him to other women’s lips.  He could kiss her lips, rest his own physical lips upon them, but it would be with the lofty and awful fervor with which one would kiss the robe of God.  He was not conscious of this transvaluation of values that had taken place in him, and was unaware that the light that shone in his eyes when he looked at her was quite the same light that shines in all men’s eyes when the desire of love is upon them.  He did not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze was, nor that the warm flame of it was affecting the alchemy of her spirit.  Her penetrative virginity exalted and disguised his own emotions, elevating his thoughts to a star-cool chastity, and he would have been startled to learn that there was that shining out of his eyes, like warm waves, that flowed through her and kindled a kindred warmth.  She was subtly perturbed by it, and more than once, though she knew not why, it disrupted her train of thought with its delicious intrusion and compelled her to grope for the remainder of ideas partly uttered.  Speech was always easy with her, and these interruptions would have puzzled her had she not decided that it was because he was a remarkable type.  She was very sensitive to impressions, and it was not strange, after all, that this aura of a traveller from another world should so affect her.

The problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help him, and she turned the conversation in that direction; but it was Martin who came to the point first.

“I wonder if I can get some advice from you,” he began, and received an acquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound.  “You remember the other time I was here I said I couldn’t talk about books an’ things because I didn’t know how?  Well, I’ve ben doin’ a lot of thinkin’ ever since.  I’ve ben to the library a whole lot, but most of the books I’ve tackled have ben over my head.  Mebbe I’d better begin at the beginnin’.  I ain’t never had no advantages.  I’ve worked pretty hard ever since I was a kid, an’ since I’ve ben to the library, lookin’ with new eyes at books—an’ lookin’ at new books, too—I’ve just about concluded that I ain’t ben reading the right kind.  You know the books you find in cattle-camps an’ fo’c’s’ls ain’t the same you’ve got in this house, for instance.  Well, that’s the sort of readin’ matter I’ve ben accustomed to.  And yet—an’ I ain’t just makin’ a brag of it—I’ve ben different from the people I’ve herded with.  Not that I’m any better than the sailors an’ cow-punchers I travelled with,—I was cow-punchin’ for a short time, you know,—but I always liked books, read everything I could lay hands on, an’—well, I guess I think differently from most of ’em.

“Now, to come to what I’m drivin’ at.  I was never inside a house like this.  When I come a week ago, an’ saw all this, an’ you, an’ your mother, an’ brothers, an’ everything—well, I liked it.  I’d heard about such things an’ read about such things in some of the books, an’ when I looked around at your house, why, the books come true.  But the thing I’m after is I liked it.  I wanted it.  I want it now.  I want to breathe air like you get in this house—air that is filled with books, and pictures, and beautiful things, where people talk in low voices an’ are clean, an’ their thoughts are clean.  The air I always breathed was mixed up with grub an’ house-rent an’ scrappin’ an booze an’ that’s all they talked about, too.  Why, when you was crossin’ the room to kiss your mother, I thought it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen.  I’ve seen a whole lot of life, an’ somehow I’ve seen a whole lot more of it than most of them that was with me.  I like to see, an’ I want to see more, an’ I want to see it different.

“But I ain’t got to the point yet.  Here it is.  I want to make my way to the kind of life you have in this house.  There’s more in life than booze, an’ hard work, an’ knockin’ about.  Now, how am I goin’ to get it?  Where do I take hold an’ begin?  I’m willin’ to work my passage, you know, an’ I can make most men sick when it comes to hard work.  Once I get started, I’ll work night an’ day.  Mebbe you think it’s funny, me askin’ you about all this.  I know you’re the last person in the world I ought to ask, but I don’t know anybody else I could ask—unless it’s Arthur.  Mebbe I ought to ask him.  If I was—”

His voice died away.  His firmly planned intention had come to a halt on the verge of the horrible probability that he should have asked Arthur and that he had made a fool of himself.  Ruth did not speak immediately.  She was too absorbed in striving to reconcile the stumbling, uncouth speech and its simplicity of thought with what she saw in his face.  She had never looked in eyes that expressed greater power.  Here was a man who could do anything, was the message she read there, and it accorded ill with the weakness of his spoken thought.  And for that matter so complex and quick was her own mind that she did not have a just appreciation of simplicity.  And yet she had caught an impression of power in the very groping of this mind.  It had seemed to her like a giant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down.  Her face was all sympathy when she did speak.

“What you need, you realize yourself, and it is education.  You should go back and finish grammar school, and then go through to high school and university.”

“But that takes money,” he interrupted.

“Oh!” she cried.  “I had not thought of that.  But then you have relatives, somebody who could assist you?”

He shook his head.

“My father and mother are dead.  I’ve two sisters, one married, an’ the other’ll get married soon, I suppose.  Then I’ve a string of brothers,—I’m the youngest,—but they never helped nobody.  They’ve just knocked around over the world, lookin’ out for number one.  The oldest died in India.  Two are in South Africa now, an’ another’s on a whaling voyage, an’ one’s travellin’ with a circus—he does trapeze work.  An’ I guess I’m just like them.  I’ve taken care of myself since I was eleven—that’s when my mother died.  I’ve got to study by myself, I guess, an’ what I want to know is where to begin.”

“I should say the first thing of all would be to get a grammar.  Your grammar is—”  She had intended saying “awful,” but she amended it to “is not particularly good.”

He flushed and sweated.

“I know I must talk a lot of slang an’ words you don’t understand.  But then they’re the only words I know—how to speak.  I’ve got other words in my mind, picked ’em up from books, but I can’t pronounce ’em, so I don’t use ’em.”

“It isn’t what you say, so much as how you say it.  You don’t mind my being frank, do you?  I don’t want to hurt you.”

“No, no,” he cried, while he secretly blessed her for her kindness.  “Fire away.  I’ve got to know, an’ I’d sooner know from you than anybody else.”

“Well, then, you say, ‘You was’; it should be, ‘You were.’  You say ‘I seen’ for ‘I saw.’  You use the double negative—”

“What’s the double negative?” he demanded; then added humbly, “You see, I don’t even understand your explanations.”

“I’m afraid I didn’t explain that,” she smiled.  “A double negative is—let me see—well, you say, ‘never helped nobody.’  ‘Never’ is a negative.  ‘Nobody’ is another negative.  It is a rule that two negatives make a positive.  ‘Never helped nobody’ means that, not helping nobody, they must have helped somebody.”

“That’s pretty clear,” he said.  “I never thought of it before.  But it don’t mean they must have helped somebody, does it?  Seems to me that ‘never helped nobody’ just naturally fails to say whether or not they helped somebody.  I never thought of it before, and I’ll never say it again.”

She was pleased and surprised with the quickness and surety of his mind.  As soon as he had got the clew he not only understood but corrected her error.

“You’ll find it all in the grammar,” she went on.  “There’s something else I noticed in your speech.  You say ‘don’t’ when you shouldn’t.  ‘Don’t’ is a contraction and stands for two words.  Do you know them?”

He thought a moment, then answered, “‘Do not.’”

She nodded her head, and said, “And you use ‘don’t’ when you mean ‘does not.’”

He was puzzled over this, and did not get it so quickly.

“Give me an illustration,” he asked.

“Well—”  She puckered her brows and pursed up her mouth as she thought, while he looked on and decided that her expression was most adorable.  “‘It don’t do to be hasty.’  Change ‘don’t’ to ‘do not,’ and it reads, ‘It do not do to be hasty,’ which is perfectly absurd.”

He turned it over in his mind and considered.

“Doesn’t it jar on your ear?” she suggested.

“Can’t say that it does,” he replied judicially.

“Why didn’t you say, ‘Can’t say that it do’?” she queried.

“That sounds wrong,” he said slowly.  “As for the other I can’t make up my mind.  I guess my ear ain’t had the trainin’ yours has.”

“There is no such word as ‘ain’t,’” she said, prettily emphatic.

Martin flushed again.

“And you say ‘ben’ for ‘been,’” she continued; “‘come’ for ‘came’; and the way you chop your endings is something dreadful.”

“How do you mean?”  He leaned forward, feeling that he ought to get down on his knees before so marvellous a mind.  “How do I chop?”

“You don’t complete the endings.  ‘A-n-d’ spells ‘and.’  You pronounce it ‘an’.’  ‘I-n-g’ spells ‘ing.’  Sometimes you pronounce it ‘ing’ and sometimes you leave off the ‘g.’  And then you slur by dropping initial letters and diphthongs.  ‘T-h-e-m’ spells ‘them.’  You pronounce it—oh, well, it is not necessary to go over all of them.  What you need is the grammar.  I’ll get one and show you how to begin.”

As she arose, there shot through his mind something that he had read in the etiquette books, and he stood up awkwardly, worrying as to whether he was doing the right thing, and fearing that she might take it as a sign that he was about to go.

“By the way, Mr. Eden,” she called back, as she was leaving the room.  “What is booze?  You used it several times, you know.”

“Oh, booze,” he laughed.  “It’s slang.  It means whiskey an’ beer—anything that will make you drunk.”

“And another thing,” she laughed back.  “Don’t use ‘you’ when you are impersonal.  ‘You’ is very personal, and your use of it just now was not precisely what you meant.”

“I don’t just see that.”

“Why, you said just now, to me, ‘whiskey and beer—anything that will make you drunk’—make me drunk, don’t you see?”

“Well, it would, wouldn’t it?”

“Yes, of course,” she smiled.  “But it would be nicer not to bring me into it.  Substitute ‘one’ for ‘you’ and see how much better it sounds.”

When she returned with the grammar, she drew a chair near his—he wondered if he should have helped her with the chair—and sat down beside him.  She turned the pages of the grammar, and their heads were inclined toward each other.  He could hardly follow her outlining of the work he must do, so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity.  But when she began to lay down the importance of conjugation, he forgot all about her.  He had never heard of conjugation, and was fascinated by the glimpse he was catching into the tie-ribs of language.  He leaned closer to the page, and her hair touched his cheek.  He had fainted but once in his life, and he thought he was going to faint again.  He could scarcely breathe, and his heart was pounding the blood up into his throat and suffocating him.  Never had she seemed so accessible as now.  For the moment the great gulf that separated them was bridged.  But there was no diminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her.  She had not descended to him.  It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and carried to her.  His reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same order as religious awe and fervor.  It seemed to him that he had intruded upon the holy of holies, and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which she had not been aware.

CHAPTER VIII

Several weeks went by, during which Martin Eden studied his grammar, reviewed the books on etiquette, and read voraciously the books that caught his fancy.  Of his own class he saw nothing.  The girls of the Lotus Club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with questions, and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley’s were glad that Martin came no more.  He made another discovery of treasure-trove in the library.  As the grammar had shown him the tie-ribs of language, so that book showed him the tie-ribs of poetry, and he began to learn metre and construction and form, beneath the beauty he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty.  Another modern book he found treated poetry as a representative art, treated it exhaustively, with copious illustrations from the best in literature.  Never had he read fiction with so keen zest as he studied these books.  And his fresh mind, untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity of desire, gripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the student mind.

When he looked back now from his vantage-ground, the old world he had known, the world of land and sea and ships, of sailor-men and harpy-women, seemed a very small world; and yet it blended in with this new world and expanded.  His mind made for unity, and he was surprised when at first he began to see points of contact between the two worlds.  And he was ennobled, as well, by the loftiness of thought and beauty he found in the books.  This led him to believe more firmly than ever that up above him, in society like Ruth and her family, all men and women thought these thoughts and lived them.  Down below where he lived was the ignoble, and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had soiled all his days, and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt the upper classes.  All his childhood and youth had been troubled by a vague unrest; he had never known what he wanted, but he had wanted something that he had hunted vainly for until he met Ruth.  And now his unrest had become sharp and painful, and he knew at last, clearly and definitely, that it was beauty, and intellect, and love that he must have.

During those several weeks he saw Ruth half a dozen times, and each time was an added inspiration.  She helped him with his English, corrected his pronunciation, and started him on arithmetic.  But their intercourse was not all devoted to elementary study.  He had seen too much of life, and his mind was too matured, to be wholly content with fractions, cube root, parsing, and analysis; and there were times when their conversation turned on other themes—the last poetry he had read, the latest poet she had studied.  And when she read aloud to him her favorite passages, he ascended to the topmost heaven of delight.  Never, in all the women he had heard speak, had he heard a voice like hers.  The least sound of it was a stimulus to his love, and he thrilled and throbbed with every word she uttered.  It was the quality of it, the repose, and the musical modulation—the soft, rich, indefinable product of culture and a gentle soul.  As he listened to her, there rang in the ears of his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags, and, in lesser degrees of harshness, the strident voices of working women and of the girls of his own class.  Then the chemistry of vision would begin to work, and they would troop in review across his mind, each, by contrast, multiplying Ruth’s glories.  Then, too, his bliss was heightened by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she read and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written thought.  She read to him much from “The Princess,” and often he saw her eyes swimming with tears, so finely was her aesthetic nature strung.  At such moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a god, and, as he gazed at her and listened, he seemed gazing on the face of life and reading its deepest secrets.  And then, becoming aware of the heights of exquisite sensibility he attained, he decided that this was love and that love was the greatest thing in the world.  And in review would pass along the corridors of memory all previous thrills and burnings he had known,—the drunkenness of wine, the caresses of women, the rough play and give and take of physical contests,—and they seemed trivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now enjoyed.

The situation was obscured to Ruth.  She had never had any experiences of the heart.  Her only experiences in such matters were of the books, where the facts of ordinary day were translated by fancy into a fairy realm of unreality; and she little knew that this rough sailor was creeping into her heart and storing there pent forces that would some day burst forth and surge through her in waves of fire.  She did not know the actual fire of love.  Her knowledge of love was purely theoretical, and she conceived of it as lambent flame, gentle as the fall of dew or the ripple of quiet water, and cool as the velvet-dark of summer nights.  Her idea of love was more that of placid affection, serving the loved one softly in an atmosphere, flower-scented and dim-lighted, of ethereal calm.  She did not dream of the volcanic convulsions of love, its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched ashes.  She knew neither her own potencies, nor the potencies of the world; and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion.  The conjugal affection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of love-affinity, and she looked forward some day to emerging, without shock or friction, into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a loved one.

So it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty, a strange individual, and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects he produced upon her.  It was only natural.  In similar ways she had experienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals in the menagerie, or when she witnessed a storm of wind, or shuddered at the bright-ribbed lightning.  There was something cosmic in such things, and there was something cosmic in him.  He came to her breathing of large airs and great spaces.  The blaze of tropic suns was in his face, and in his swelling, resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life.  He was marred and scarred by that mysterious world of rough men and rougher deeds, the outposts of which began beyond her horizon.  He was untamed, wild, and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact that he came so mildly to her hand.  Likewise she was stirred by the common impulse to tame the wild thing.  It was an unconscious impulse, and farthest from her thoughts that her desire was to re-thumb the clay of him into a likeness of her father’s image, which image she believed to be the finest in the world.  Nor was there any way, out of her inexperience, for her to know that the cosmic feel she caught of him was that most cosmic of things, love, which with equal power drew men and women together across the world, compelled stags to kill each other in the rutting season, and drove even the elements irresistibly to unite.

His swift development was a source of surprise and interest.  She detected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by day, like flowers in congenial soil.  She read Browning aloud to him, and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages.  It was beyond her to realize that, out of his experience of men and women and life, his interpretations were far more frequently correct than hers.  His conceptions seemed naive to her, though she was often fired by his daring flights of comprehension, whose orbit-path was so wide among the stars that she could not follow and could only sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power.  Then she played to him—no longer at him—and probed him with music that sank to depths beyond her plumb-line.  His nature opened to music as a flower to the sun, and the transition was quick from his working-class rag-time and jingles to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart.  Yet he betrayed a democratic fondness for Wagner, and the “Tannhäuser” overture, when she had given him the clew to it, claimed him as nothing else she played.  In an immediate way it personified his life.  All his past was the Venusburg motif, while her he identified somehow with the Pilgrim’s Chorus motif; and from the exalted state this elevated him to, he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow-realm of spirit-groping, where good and evil war eternally.

Sometimes he questioned, and induced in her mind temporary doubts as to the correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music.  But her singing he did not question.  It was too wholly her, and he sat always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice.  And he could not help but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill quaverings of factory girls, ill-nourished and untrained, and with the raucous shriekings from gin-cracked throats of the women of the seaport towns.  She enjoyed singing and playing to him.  In truth, it was the first time she had ever had a human soul to play with, and the plastic clay of him was a delight to mould; for she thought she was moulding it, and her intentions were good.  Besides, it was pleasant to be with him.  He did not repel her.  That first repulsion had been really a fear of her undiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep.  Though she did not know it, she had a feeling in him of proprietary right.  Also, he had a tonic effect upon her.  She was studying hard at the university, and it seemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty books and have the fresh sea-breeze of his personality blow upon her.  Strength!  Strength was what she needed, and he gave it to her in generous measure.  To come into the same room with him, or to meet him at the door, was to take heart of life.  And when he had gone, she would return to her books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy.

She knew her Browning, but it had never sunk into her that it was an awkward thing to play with souls.  As her interest in Martin increased, the remodelling of his life became a passion with her.

“There is Mr. Butler,” she said one afternoon, when grammar and arithmetic and poetry had been put aside.

“He had comparatively no advantages at first.  His father had been a bank cashier, but he lingered for years, dying of consumption in Arizona, so that when he was dead, Mr. Butler, Charles Butler he was called, found himself alone in the world.  His father had come from Australia, you know, and so he had no relatives in California.  He went to work in a printing-office,—I have heard him tell of it many times,—and he got three dollars a week, at first.  His income to-day is at least thirty thousand a year.  How did he do it?  He was honest, and faithful, and industrious, and economical.  He denied himself the enjoyments that most boys indulge in.  He made it a point to save so much every week, no matter what he had to do without in order to save it.  Of course, he was soon earning more than three dollars a week, and as his wages increased he saved more and more.

“He worked in the daytime, and at night he went to night school.  He had his eyes fixed always on the future.  Later on he went to night high school.  When he was only seventeen, he was earning excellent wages at setting type, but he was ambitious.  He wanted a career, not a livelihood, and he was content to make immediate sacrifices for his ultimate again.  He decided upon the law, and he entered father’s office as an office boy—think of that!—and got only four dollars a week.  But he had learned how to be economical, and out of that four dollars he went on saving money.”

She paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it.  His face was lighted up with interest in the youthful struggles of Mr. Butler; but there was a frown upon his face as well.

“I’d say they was pretty hard lines for a young fellow,” he remarked.  “Four dollars a week!  How could he live on it?  You can bet he didn’t have any frills.  Why, I pay five dollars a week for board now, an’ there’s nothin’ excitin’ about it, you can lay to that.  He must have lived like a dog.  The food he ate—”

“He cooked for himself,” she interrupted, “on a little kerosene stove.”

“The food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets on the worst-feedin’ deep-water ships, than which there ain’t much that can be possibly worse.”

“But think of him now!” she cried enthusiastically.  “Think of what his income affords him.  His early denials are paid for a thousand-fold.”

Martin looked at her sharply.

“There’s one thing I’ll bet you,” he said, “and it is that Mr. Butler is nothin’ gay-hearted now in his fat days.  He fed himself like that for years an’ years, on a boy’s stomach, an’ I bet his stomach’s none too good now for it.”

Her eyes dropped before his searching gaze.

“I’ll bet he’s got dyspepsia right now!” Martin challenged.

“Yes, he has,” she confessed; “but—”

“An’ I bet,” Martin dashed on, “that he’s solemn an’ serious as an old owl, an’ doesn’t care a rap for a good time, for all his thirty thousand a year.  An’ I’ll bet he’s not particularly joyful at seein’ others have a good time.  Ain’t I right?”

She nodded her head in agreement, and hastened to explain:-

“But he is not that type of man.  By nature he is sober and serious.  He always was that.”

“You can bet he was,” Martin proclaimed.  “Three dollars a week, an’ four dollars a week, an’ a young boy cookin’ for himself on an oil-burner an’ layin’ up money, workin’ all day an’ studyin’ all night, just workin’ an’ never playin’, never havin’ a good time, an’ never learnin’ how to have a good time—of course his thirty thousand came along too late.”

His sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all the thousands of details of the boy’s existence and of his narrow spiritual development into a thirty-thousand-dollar-a-year man.  With the swiftness and wide-reaching of multitudinous thought Charles Butler’s whole life was telescoped upon his vision.

“Do you know,” he added, “I feel sorry for Mr. Butler.  He was too young to know better, but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty thousand a year that’s clean wasted upon him.  Why, thirty thousand, lump sum, wouldn’t buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin’ up would have bought him, when he was a kid, in the way of candy an’ peanuts or a seat in nigger heaven.”

It was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled Ruth.  Not only were they new to her, and contrary to her own beliefs, but she always felt in them germs of truth that threatened to unseat or modify her own convictions.  Had she been fourteen instead of twenty-four, she might have been changed by them; but she was twenty-four, conservative by nature and upbringing, and already crystallized into the cranny of life where she had been born and formed.  It was true, his bizarre judgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered, but she ascribed them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living, and they were soon forgotten.  Nevertheless, while she disapproved of them, the strength of their utterance, and the flashing of eyes and earnestness of face that accompanied them, always thrilled her and drew her toward him.  She would never have guessed that this man who had come from beyond her horizon, was, in such moments, flashing on beyond her horizon with wider and deeper concepts.  Her own limits were the limits of her horizon; but limited minds can recognize limitations only in others.  And so she felt that her outlook was very wide indeed, and that where his conflicted with hers marked his limitations; and she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw, of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers.

“But I have not finished my story,” she said.  “He worked, so father says, as no other office boy he ever had.  Mr. Butler was always eager to work.  He never was late, and he was usually at the office a few minutes before his regular time.  And yet he saved his time.  Every spare moment was devoted to study.  He studied book-keeping and type-writing, and he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice.  He quickly became a clerk, and he made himself invaluable.  Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise.  It was on father’s suggestion that he went to law college.  He became a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner.  He is a great man.  He refused the United States Senate several times, and father says he could become a justice of the Supreme Court any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to.  Such a life is an inspiration to all of us.  It shows us that a man with will may rise superior to his environment.”

“He is a great man,” Martin said sincerely.

But it seemed to him there was something in the recital that jarred upon his sense of beauty and life.  He could not find an adequate motive in Mr. Butler’s life of pinching and privation.  Had he done it for love of a woman, or for attainment of beauty, Martin would have understood.  God’s own mad lover should do anything for the kiss, but not for thirty thousand dollars a year.  He was dissatisfied with Mr. Butler’s career.  There was something paltry about it, after all.  Thirty thousand a year was all right, but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed such princely income of all its value.

Much of this he strove to express to Ruth, and shocked her and made it clear that more remodelling was necessary.  Hers was that common insularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color, creed, and politics are best and right and that other human creatures scattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they.  It was the same insularity of mind that made the ancient Jew thank God he was not born a woman, and sent the modern missionary god-substituting to the ends of the earth; and it made Ruth desire to shape this man from other crannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in her particular cranny of life.

CHAPTER IX

Back from sea Martin Eden came, homing for California with a lover’s desire.  His store of money exhausted, he had shipped before the mast on the treasure-hunting schooner; and the Solomon Islands, after eight months of failure to find treasure, had witnessed the breaking up of the expedition.  The men had been paid off in Australia, and Martin had immediately shipped on a deep-water vessel for San Francisco.  Not alone had those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many weeks, but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and reading.

His was the student’s mind, and behind his ability to learn was the indomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth.  The grammar he had taken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had mastered it.  He noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates, and made a point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of speech.  To his great joy he discovered that his ear was becoming sensitive and that he was developing grammatical nerves.  A double negative jarred him like a discord, and often, from lack of practice, it was from his own lips that the jar came.  His tongue refused to learn new tricks in a day.

After he had been through the grammar repeatedly, he took up the dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary.  He found that this was no light task, and at wheel or lookout he steadily went over and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions, while he invariably memorized himself to sleep.  “Never did anything,” “if I were,” and “those things,” were phrases, with many variations, that he repeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to the language spoken by Ruth.  “And” and “ing,” with the “d” and “g” pronounced emphatically, he went over thousands of times; and to his surprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more correct English than the officers themselves and the gentleman-adventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition.

The captain was a fishy-eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into possession of a complete Shakespeare, which he never read, and Martin had washed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to the precious volumes.  For a time, so steeped was he in the plays and in the many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without effort on his brain, that all the world seemed to shape itself into forms of Elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in blank verse.  It trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation for noble English; withal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic and obsolete.

The eight months had been well spent, and, in addition to what he had learned of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much of himself.  Along with his humbleness because he knew so little, there arose a conviction of power.  He felt a sharp gradation between himself and his shipmates, and was wise enough to realize that the difference lay in potentiality rather than achievement.  What he could do,—they could do; but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told him there was more in him than he had done.  He was tortured by the exquisite beauty of the world, and wished that Ruth were there to share it with him.  He decided that he would describe to her many of the bits of South Sea beauty.  The creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than Ruth.  And then, in splendor and glory, came the great idea.  He would write.  He would be one of the eyes through which the world saw, one of the ears through which it heard, one of the hearts through which it felt.  He would write—everything—poetry and prose, fiction and description, and plays like Shakespeare.  There was career and the way to win to Ruth.  The men of literature were the world’s giants, and he conceived them to be far finer than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.

Once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to San Francisco was like a dream.  He was drunken with unguessed power and felt that he could do anything.  In the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained perspective.  Clearly, and for the first lime, he saw Ruth and her world.  It was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and examine.  There was much that was dim and nebulous in that world, but he saw it as a whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to master it.  To write!  The thought was fire in him.  He would begin as soon as he got back.  The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasure-hunters.  He would sell it to some San Francisco newspaper.  He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print.  While he wrote, he could go on studying.  There were twenty-four hours in each day.  He was invincible.  He knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him.  He would not have to go to sea again—as a sailor; and for the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht.  There were other writers who possessed steam yachts.  Of course, he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding at first, and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying.  And then, after some time,—a very indeterminate time,—when he had learned and prepared himself, he would write the great things and his name would be on all men’s lips.  But greater than that, infinitely greater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of Ruth.  Fame was all very well, but it was for Ruth that his splendid dream arose.  He was not a fame-monger, but merely one of God’s mad lovers.

Arrived in Oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took up his old room at Bernard Higginbotham’s and set to work.  He did not even let Ruth know he was back.  He would go and see her when he finished the article on the treasure-hunters.  It was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him.  Besides, the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to him.  He did not know how long an article he should write, but he counted the words in a double-page article in the Sunday supplement of the San Francisco Examiner, and guided himself by that.  Three days, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks.  He had never thought of such things before; and he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring continually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year.  When he had copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners, and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written on one side of the paper.  He had violated the law on both counts.  Also, he learned from the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column.  So, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars.  The product was always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was better than seafaring.  If it hadn’t been for his blunders, he would have finished the article in three days.  One hundred dollars in three days!  It would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount.  A man was a fool to go to sea when he could write, he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him.  Its value was in the liberty it would get him, the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer, swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration.

He mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope, and addressed it to the editor of the San Francisco Examiner.  He had an idea that anything accepted by a paper was published immediately, and as he had sent the manuscript in on Friday he expected it to come out on the following Sunday.  He conceived that it would be fine to let that event apprise Ruth of his return.  Then, Sunday afternoon, he would call and see her.  In the meantime he was occupied by another idea, which he prided himself upon as being a particularly sane, careful, and modest idea.  He would write an adventure story for boys and sell it to The Youth’s Companion.  He went to the free reading-room and looked through the files of The Youth’s Companion.  Serial stories, he found, were usually published in that weekly in five instalments of about three thousand words each.  He discovered several serials that ran to seven instalments, and decided to write one of that length.

He had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic, once—a voyage that was to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the end of six months.  While his imagination was fanciful, even fantastic at times, he had a basic love of reality that compelled him to write about the things he knew.  He knew whaling, and out of the real materials of his knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the fictitious adventures of the two boys he intended to use as joint heroes.  It was easy work, he decided on Saturday evening.  He had completed on that day the first instalment of three thousand words—much to the amusement of Jim, and to the open derision of Mr. Higginbotham, who sneered throughout meal-time at the “litery” person they had discovered in the family.

Martin contented himself by picturing his brother-in-law’s surprise on Sunday morning when he opened his Examiner and saw the article on the treasure-hunters.  Early that morning he was out himself to the front door, nervously racing through the many-sheeted newspaper.  He went through it a second time, very carefully, then folded it up and left it where he had found it.  He was glad he had not told any one about his article.  On second thought he concluded that he had been wrong about the speed with which things found their way into newspaper columns.  Besides, there had not been any news value in his article, and most likely the editor would write to him about it first.

After breakfast he went on with his serial.  The words flowed from his pen, though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up definitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric.  He often read or re-read a chapter at a time, during such pauses; and he consoled himself that while he was not writing the great things he felt to be in him, he was learning composition, at any rate, and training himself to shape up and express his thoughts.  He toiled on till dark, when he went out to the reading-room and explored magazines and weeklies until the place closed at ten o’clock.  This was his programme for a week.  Each day he did three thousand words, and each evening he puzzled his way through the magazines, taking note of the stories, articles, and poems that editors saw fit to publish.  One thing was certain: What these multitudinous writers did he could do, and only give him time and he would do what they could not do.  He was cheered to read in Book News, in a paragraph on the payment of magazine writers, not that Rudyard Kipling received a dollar per word, but that the minimum rate paid by first-class magazines was two cents a word.  The Youth’s Companion was certainly first class, and at that rate the three thousand words he had written that day would bring him sixty dollars—two months’ wages on the sea!

On Friday night he finished the serial, twenty-one thousand words long.  At two cents a word, he calculated, that would bring him four hundred and twenty dollars.  Not a bad week’s work.  It was more money than he had ever possessed at one time.  He did not know how he could spend it all.  He had tapped a gold mine.  Where this came from he could always get more.  He planned to buy some more clothes, to subscribe to many magazines, and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was compelled to go to the library to consult.  And still there was a large portion of the four hundred and twenty dollars unspent.  This worried him until the thought came to him of hiring a servant for Gertrude and of buying a bicycle for Marion.

He mailed the bulky manuscript to The Youth’s Companion, and on Saturday afternoon, after having planned an article on pearl-diving, he went to see Ruth.  He had telephoned, and she went herself to greet him at the door.  The old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and struck her like a blow.  It seemed to enter into her body and course through her veins in a liquid glow, and to set her quivering with its imparted strength.  He flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked into her blue eyes, but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the flush, though it did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the stiff collar.  She noted the red line of it with amusement which quickly vanished as she glanced at his clothes.  They really fitted him,—it was his first made-to-order suit,—and he seemed slimmer and better modelled.  In addition, his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat, which she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his appearance.  She did not remember when she had felt so happy.  This change in him was her handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him.

But the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most, was the change in his speech.  Not only did he speak more correctly, but he spoke more easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary.  When he grew excited or enthusiastic, however, he dropped back into the old slurring and the dropping of final consonants.  Also, there was an awkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new words he had learned.  On the other hand, along with his ease of expression, he displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her.  It was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a favorite in his own class, but which he had hitherto been unable to use in her presence through lack of words and training.  He was just beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder.  But he was very tentative, fastidiously so, letting Ruth set the pace of sprightliness and fancy, keeping up with her but never daring to go beyond her.

He told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for a livelihood and of going on with his studies.  But he was disappointed at her lack of approval.  She did not think much of his plan.

“You see,” she said frankly, “writing must be a trade, like anything else.  Not that I know anything about it, of course.  I only bring common judgment to bear.  You couldn’t hope to be a blacksmith without spending three years at learning the trade—or is it five years!  Now writers are so much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many more men who would like to write, who—try to write.”

“But then, may not I be peculiarly constituted to write?” he queried, secretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift imagination throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a thousand other scenes from his life—scenes that were rough and raw, gross and bestial.

The whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light, producing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train of thought.  On the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this sweet and beautiful girl, facing each other and conversing in good English, in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture, and all illuminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance; while ranged about and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were antithetical scenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker, free to look at will upon what he wished.  He saw these other scenes through drifting vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and garish light.  He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce whiskey, the air filled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw himself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at table with them, under smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked and clattered and the cards were dealt around.  He saw himself, stripped to the waist, with naked fists, fighting his great fight with Liverpool Red in the forecastle of the Susquehanna; and he saw the bloody deck of the John Rogers, that gray morning of attempted mutiny, the mate kicking in death-throes on the main-hatch, the revolver in the old man’s hand spitting fire and smoke, the men with passion-wrenched faces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him—and then he returned to the central scene, calm and clean in the steadfast light, where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings; and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him; and he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words, “But then, may I not be peculiarly constituted to write?”

“But no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for blacksmithing,” she was laughing, “I never heard of one becoming a blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship.”

“What would you advise?” he asked.  “And don’t forget that I feel in me this capacity to write—I can’t explain it; I just know that it is in me.”

“You must get a thorough education,” was the answer, “whether or not you ultimately become a writer.  This education is indispensable for whatever career you select, and it must not be slipshod or sketchy.  You should go to high school.”

“Yes—” he began; but she interrupted with an afterthought:-

“Of course, you could go on with your writing, too.”

“I would have to,” he said grimly.

“Why?”  She looked at him, prettily puzzled, for she did not quite like the persistence with which he clung to his notion.

“Because, without writing there wouldn’t be any high school.  I must live and buy books and clothes, you know.”

“I’d forgotten that,” she laughed.  “Why weren’t you born with an income?”

“I’d rather have good health and imagination,” he answered.  “I can make good on the income, but the other things have to be made good for—”  He almost said “you,” then amended his sentence to, “have to be made good for one.”

“Don’t say ‘make good,’” she cried, sweetly petulant.  “It’s slang, and it’s horrid.”

He flushed, and stammered, “That’s right, and I only wish you’d correct me every time.”

“I—I’d like to,” she said haltingly.  “You have so much in you that is good that I want to see you perfect.”

He was clay in her hands immediately, as passionately desirous of being moulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her ideal of man.  And when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time, that the entrance examinations to high school began on the following Monday, he promptly volunteered that he would take them.

Then she played and sang to him, while he gazed with hungry yearning at her, drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should not be a hundred suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened and longed.

CHAPTER X

He stopped to dinner that evening, and, much to Ruth’s satisfaction, made a favorable impression on her father.  They talked about the sea as a career, a subject which Martin had at his finger-ends, and Mr. Morse remarked afterward that he seemed a very clear-headed young man.  In his avoidance of slang and his search after right words, Martin was compelled to talk slowly, which enabled him to find the best thoughts that were in him.  He was more at ease than that first night at dinner, nearly a year before, and his shyness and modesty even commended him to Mrs. Morse, who was pleased at his manifest improvement.

“He is the first man that ever drew passing notice from Ruth,” she told her husband.  “She has been so singularly backward where men are concerned that I have been worried greatly.”

Mr. Morse looked at his wife curiously.

“You mean to use this young sailor to wake her up?” he questioned.

“I mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it,” was the answer.  “If this young Eden can arouse her interest in mankind in general, it will be a good thing.”

“A very good thing,” he commented.  “But suppose,—and we must suppose, sometimes, my dear,—suppose he arouses her interest too particularly in him?”

“Impossible,” Mrs. Morse laughed.  “She is three years older than he, and, besides, it is impossible.  Nothing will ever come of it.  Trust that to me.”

And so Martin’s rôle was arranged for him, while he, led on by Arthur and Norman, was meditating an extravagance.  They were going out for a ride into the hills Sunday morning on their wheels, which did not interest Martin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode a wheel and was going along.  He did not ride, nor own a wheel, but if Ruth rode, it was up to him to begin, was his decision; and when he said good night, he stopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a wheel.  It was more than a month’s hard-earned wages, and it reduced his stock of money amazingly; but when he added the hundred dollars he was to receive from the Examiner to the four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least The Youth’s Companion could pay him, he felt that he had reduced the perplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused him.  Nor did he mind, in the course of learning to ride the wheel home, the fact that he ruined his suit of clothes.  He caught the tailor by telephone that night from Mr. Higginbotham’s store and ordered another suit.  Then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like a fire-escape to the rear wall of the building, and when he had moved his bed out from the wall, found there was just space enough in the small room for himself and the wheel.

Sunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school examination, but the pearl-diving article lured him away, and he spent the day in the white-hot fever of re-creating the beauty and romance that burned in him.  The fact that the Examiner of that morning had failed to publish his treasure-hunting article did not dash his spirits.  He was at too great a height for that, and having been deaf to a twice-repeated summons, he went without the heavy Sunday dinner with which Mr. Higginbotham invariably graced his table.  To Mr. Higginbotham such a dinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement and prosperity, and he honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes upon American institutions and the opportunity said institutions gave to any hard-working man to rise—the rise, in his case, which he pointed out unfailingly, being from a grocer’s clerk to the ownership of Higginbotham’s Cash Store.

Martin Eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished “Pearl-diving” on Monday morning, and took the car down to Oakland to the high school.  And when, days later, he applied for the results of his examinations, he learned that he had failed in everything save grammar.

“Your grammar is excellent,” Professor Hilton informed him, staring at him through heavy spectacles; “but you know nothing, positively nothing, in the other branches, and your United States history is abominable—there is no other word for it, abominable.  I should advise you—”

Professor Hilton paused and glared at him, unsympathetic and unimaginative as one of his own test-tubes.  He was professor of physics in the high school, possessor of a large family, a meagre salary, and a select fund of parrot-learned knowledge.

“Yes, sir,” Martin said humbly, wishing somehow that the man at the desk in the library was in Professor Hilton’s place just then.

“And I should advise you to go back to the grammar school for at least two years.  Good day.”

Martin was not deeply affected by his failure, though he was surprised at Ruth’s shocked expression when he told her Professor Hilton’s advice.  Her disappointment was so evident that he was sorry he had failed, but chiefly so for her sake.

“You see I was right,” she said.  “You know far more than any of the students entering high school, and yet you can’t pass the examinations.  It is because what education you have is fragmentary, sketchy.  You need the discipline of study, such as only skilled teachers can give you.  You must be thoroughly grounded.  Professor Hilton is right, and if I were you, I’d go to night school.  A year and a half of it might enable you to catch up that additional six months.  Besides, that would leave you your days in which to write, or, if you could not make your living by your pen, you would have your days in which to work in some position.”

But if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school, when am I going to see you?—was Martin’s first thought, though he refrained from uttering it.  Instead, he said:-

“It seems so babyish for me to be going to night school.  But I wouldn’t mind that if I thought it would pay.  But I don’t think it will pay.  I can do the work quicker than they can teach me.  It would be a loss of time—” he thought of her and his desire to have her—“and I can’t afford the time.  I haven’t the time to spare, in fact.”

“There is so much that is necessary.”  She looked at him gently, and he was a brute to oppose her.  “Physics and chemistry—you can’t do them without laboratory study; and you’ll find algebra and geometry almost hopeless with instruction.  You need the skilled teachers, the specialists in the art of imparting knowledge.”

He was silent for a minute, casting about for the least vainglorious way in which to express himself.

“Please don’t think I’m bragging,” he began.  “I don’t intend it that way at all.  But I have a feeling that I am what I may call a natural student.  I can study by myself.  I take to it kindly, like a duck to water.  You see yourself what I did with grammar.  And I’ve learned much of other things—you would never dream how much.  And I’m only getting started.  Wait till I get—”  He hesitated and assured himself of the pronunciation before he said “momentum.  I’m getting my first real feel of things now.  I’m beginning to size up the situation—”

“Please don’t say ‘size up,’” she interrupted.

“To get a line on things,” he hastily amended.

“That doesn’t mean anything in correct English,” she objected.

He floundered for a fresh start.

“What I’m driving at is that I’m beginning to get the lay of the land.”

Out of pity she forebore, and he went on.

“Knowledge seems to me like a chart-room.  Whenever I go into the library, I am impressed that way.  The part played by teachers is to teach the student the contents of the chart-room in a systematic way.  The teachers are guides to the chart-room, that’s all.  It’s not something that they have in their own heads.  They don’t make it up, don’t create it.  It’s all in the chart-room and they know their way about in it, and it’s their business to show the place to strangers who might else get lost.  Now I don’t get lost easily.  I have the bump of location.  I usually know where I’m at—What’s wrong now?”

“Don’t say ‘where I’m at.’”

“That’s right,” he said gratefully, “where I am.  But where am I at—I mean, where am I?  Oh, yes, in the chart-room.  Well, some people—”

“Persons,” she corrected.

“Some persons need guides, most persons do; but I think I can get along without them.  I’ve spent a lot of time in the chart-room now, and I’m on the edge of knowing my way about, what charts I want to refer to, what coasts I want to explore.  And from the way I line it up, I’ll explore a whole lot more quickly by myself.  The speed of a fleet, you know, is the speed of the slowest ship, and the speed of the teachers is affected the same way.  They can’t go any faster than the ruck of their scholars, and I can set a faster pace for myself than they set for a whole schoolroom.”

“‘He travels the fastest who travels alone,’” she quoted at him.

But I’d travel faster with you just the same, was what he wanted to blurt out, as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit spaces and starry voids through which he drifted with her, his arm around her, her pale gold hair blowing about his face.  In the same instant he was aware of the pitiful inadequacy of speech.  God!  If he could so frame words that she could see what he then saw!  And he felt the stir in him, like a throe of yearning pain, of the desire to paint these visions that flashed unsummoned on the mirror of his mind.  Ah, that was it!  He caught at the hem of the secret.  It was the very thing that the great writers and master-poets did.  That was why they were giants.  They knew how to express what they thought, and felt, and saw.  Dogs asleep in the sun often whined and barked, but they were unable to tell what they saw that made them whine and bark.  He had often wondered what it was.  And that was all he was, a dog asleep in the sun.  He saw noble and beautiful visions, but he could only whine and bark at Ruth.  But he would cease sleeping in the sun.  He would stand up, with open eyes, and he would struggle and toil and learn until, with eyes unblinded and tongue untied, he could share with her his visioned wealth.  Other men had discovered the trick of expression, of making words obedient servitors, and of making combinations of words mean more than the sum of their separate meanings.  He was stirred profoundly by the passing glimpse at the secret, and he was again caught up in the vision of sunlit spaces and starry voids—until it came to him that it was very quiet, and he saw Ruth regarding him with an amused expression and a smile in her eyes.

“I have had a great visioning,” he said, and at the sound of his words in his own ears his heart gave a leap.  Where had those words come from?  They had adequately expressed the pause his vision had put in the conversation.  It was a miracle.  Never had he so loftily framed a lofty thought.  But never had he attempted to frame lofty thoughts in words.  That was it.  That explained it.  He had never tried.  But Swinburne had, and Tennyson, and Kipling, and all the other poets.  His mind flashed on to his “Pearl-diving.”  He had never dared the big things, the spirit of the beauty that was a fire in him.  That article would be a different thing when he was done with it.  He was appalled by the vastness of the beauty that rightfully belonged in it, and again his mind flashed and dared, and he demanded of himself why he could not chant that beauty in noble verse as the great poets did.  And there was all the mysterious delight and spiritual wonder of his love for Ruth.  Why could he not chant that, too, as the poets did?  They had sung of love.  So would he.  By God!—

And in his frightened ears he heard his exclamation echoing.  Carried away, he had breathed it aloud.  The blood surged into his face, wave upon wave, mastering the bronze of it till the blush of shame flaunted itself from collar-rim to the roots of his hair.

“I—I—beg your pardon,” he stammered.  “I was thinking.”

“It sounded as if you were praying,” she said bravely, but she felt herself inside to be withering and shrinking.  It was the first time she had heard an oath from the lips of a man she knew, and she was shocked, not merely as a matter of principle and training, but shocked in spirit by this rough blast of life in the garden of her sheltered maidenhood.

But she forgave, and with surprise at the ease of her forgiveness.  Somehow it was not so difficult to forgive him anything.  He had not had a chance to be as other men, and he was trying so hard, and succeeding, too.  It never entered her head that there could be any other reason for her being kindly disposed toward him.  She was tenderly disposed toward him, but she did not know it.  She had no way of knowing it.  The placid poise of twenty-four years without a single love affair did not fit her with a keen perception of her own feelings, and she who had never warmed to actual love was unaware that she was warming now.

CHAPTER XI

Martin went back to his pearl-diving article, which would have been finished sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by his attempts to write poetry.  His poems were love poems, inspired by Ruth, but they were never completed.  Not in a day could he learn to chant in noble verse.  Rhyme and metre and structure were serious enough in themselves, but there was, over and beyond them, an intangible and evasive something that he caught in all great poetry, but which he could not catch and imprison in his own.  It was the elusive spirit of poetry itself that he sensed and sought after but could not capture.  It seemed a glow to him, a warm and trailing vapor, ever beyond his reaching, though sometimes he was rewarded by catching at shreds of it and weaving them into phrases that echoed in his brain with haunting notes or drifted across his vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty.  It was baffling.  He ached with desire to express and could but gibber prosaically as everybody gibbered.  He read his fragments aloud.  The metre marched along on perfect feet, and the rhyme pounded a longer and equally faultless rhythm, but the glow and high exaltation that he felt within were lacking.  He could not understand, and time and again, in despair, defeated and depressed, he returned to his article.  Prose was certainly an easier medium.

Following the “Pearl-diving,” he wrote an article on the sea as a career, another on turtle-catching, and a third on the northeast trades.  Then he tried, as an experiment, a short story, and before he broke his stride he had finished six short stories and despatched them to various magazines.  He wrote prolifically, intensely, from morning till night, and late at night, except when he broke off to go to the reading-room, draw books from the library, or to call on Ruth.  He was profoundly happy.  Life was pitched high.  He was in a fever that never broke.  The joy of creation that is supposed to belong to the gods was his.  All the life about him—the odors of stale vegetables and soapsuds, the slatternly form of his sister, and the jeering face of Mr. Higginbotham—was a dream.  The real world was in his mind, and the stories he wrote were so many pieces of reality out of his mind.

The days were too short.  There was so much he wanted to study.  He cut his sleep down to five hours and found that he could get along upon it.  He tried four hours and a half, and regretfully came back to five.  He could joyfully have spent all his waking hours upon any one of his pursuits.  It was with regret that he ceased from writing to study, that he ceased from study to go to the library, that he tore himself away from that chart-room of knowledge or from the magazines in the reading-room that were filled with the secrets of writers who succeeded in selling their wares.  It was like severing heart strings, when he was with Ruth, to stand up and go; and he scorched through the dark streets so as to get home to his books at the least possible expense of time.  And hardest of all was it to shut up the algebra or physics, put note-book and pencil aside, and close his tired eyes in sleep.  He hated the thought of ceasing to live, even for so short a time, and his sole consolation was that the alarm clock was set five hours ahead.  He would lose only five hours anyway, and then the jangling bell would jerk him out of unconsciousness and he would have before him another glorious day of nineteen hours.

In the meantime the weeks were passing, his money was ebbing low, and there was no money coming in.  A month after he had mailed it, the adventure serial for boys was returned to him by The Youth’s Companion.  The rejection slip was so tactfully worded that he felt kindly toward the editor.  But he did not feel so kindly toward the editor of the San Francisco Examiner.  After waiting two whole weeks, Martin had written to him.  A week later he wrote again.  At the end of the month, he went over to San Francisco and personally called upon the editor.  But he did not meet that exalted personage, thanks to a Cerberus of an office boy, of tender years and red hair, who guarded the portals.  At the end of the fifth week the manuscript came back to him, by mail, without comment.  There was no rejection slip, no explanation, nothing.  In the same way his other articles were tied up with the other leading San Francisco papers.  When he recovered them, he sent them to the magazines in the East, from which they were returned more promptly, accompanied always by the printed rejection slips.

The short stories were returned in similar fashion.  He read them over and over, and liked them so much that he could not puzzle out the cause of their rejection, until, one day, he read in a newspaper that manuscripts should always be typewritten.  That explained it.  Of course editors were so busy that they could not afford the time and strain of reading handwriting.  Martin rented a typewriter and spent a day mastering the machine.  Each day he typed what he composed, and he typed his earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned him.  He was surprised when the typed ones began to come back.  His jaw seemed to become squarer, his chin more aggressive, and he bundled the manuscripts off to new editors.

The thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own work.  He tried it out on Gertrude.  He read his stories aloud to her.  Her eyes glistened, and she looked at him proudly as she said:-

“Ain’t it grand, you writin’ those sort of things.”

“Yes, yes,” he demanded impatiently.  “But the story—how did you like it?”

“Just grand,” was the reply.  “Just grand, an’ thrilling, too.  I was all worked up.”

He could see that her mind was not clear.  The perplexity was strong in her good-natured face.  So he waited.

“But, say, Mart,” after a long pause, “how did it end?  Did that young man who spoke so highfalutin’ get her?”

And, after he had explained the end, which he thought he had made artistically obvious, she would say:-

“That’s what I wanted to know.  Why didn’t you write that way in the story?”

One thing he learned, after he had read her a number of stories, namely, that she liked happy endings.

“That story was perfectly grand,” she announced, straightening up from the wash-tub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her forehead with a red, steamy hand; “but it makes me sad.  I want to cry.  There is too many sad things in the world anyway.  It makes me happy to think about happy things.  Now if he’d married her, and—You don’t mind, Mart?” she queried apprehensively.  “I just happen to feel that way, because I’m tired, I guess.  But the story was grand just the same, perfectly grand.  Where are you goin’ to sell it?”

“That’s a horse of another color,” he laughed.

“But if you did sell it, what do you think you’d get for it?”

“Oh, a hundred dollars.  That would be the least, the way prices go.”

“My!  I do hope you’ll sell it!”

“Easy money, eh?”  Then he added proudly: “I wrote it in two days.  That’s fifty dollars a day.”

He longed to read his stories to Ruth, but did not dare.  He would wait till some were published, he decided, then she would understand what he had been working for.  In the meantime he toiled on.  Never had the spirit of adventure lured him more strongly than on this amazing exploration of the realm of mind.  He bought the text-books on physics and chemistry, and, along with his algebra, worked out problems and demonstrations.  He took the laboratory proofs on faith, and his intense power of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals more understandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory.  Martin wandered on through the heavy pages, overwhelmed by the clews he was getting to the nature of things.  He had accepted the world as the world, but now he was comprehending the organization of it, the play and interplay of force and matter.  Spontaneous explanations of old matters were continually arising in his mind.  Levers and purchases fascinated him, and his mind roved backward to hand-spikes and blocks and tackles at sea.  The theory of navigation, which enabled the ships to travel unerringly their courses over the pathless ocean, was made clear to him.  The mysteries of storm, and rain, and tide were revealed, and the reason for the existence of trade-winds made him wonder whether he had written his article on the northeast trade too soon.  At any rate he knew he could write it better now.  One afternoon he went out with Arthur to the University of California, and, with bated breath and a feeling of religious awe, went through the laboratories, saw demonstrations, and listened to a physics professor lecturing to his classes.

But he did not neglect his writing.  A stream of short stories flowed from his pen, and he branched out into the easier forms of verse—the kind he saw printed in the magazines—though he lost his head and wasted two weeks on a tragedy in blank verse, the swift rejection of which, by half a dozen magazines, dumfounded him.  Then he discovered Henley and wrote a series of sea-poems on the model of “Hospital Sketches.”  They were simple poems, of light and color, and romance and adventure.  “Sea Lyrics,” he called them, and he judged them to be the best work he had yet done.  There were thirty, and he completed them in a month, doing one a day after having done his regular day’s work on fiction, which day’s work was the equivalent to a week’s work of the average successful writer.  The toil meant nothing to him.  It was not toil.  He was finding speech, and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent for years behind his inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild and virile flood.

He showed the “Sea Lyrics” to no one, not even to the editors.  He had become distrustful of editors.  But it was not distrust that prevented him from submitting the “Lyrics.”  They were so beautiful to him that he was impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some glorious, far-off time when he would dare to read to her what he had written.  Against that time he kept them with him, reading them aloud, going over them until he knew them by heart.

He lived every moment of his waking hours, and he lived in his sleep, his subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and combining the thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and impossible marvels.  In reality, he never rested, and a weaker body or a less firmly poised brain would have been prostrated in a general break-down.  His late afternoon calls on Ruth were rarer now, for June was approaching, when she would take her degree and finish with the university.  Bachelor of Arts!—when he thought of her degree, it seemed she fled beyond him faster than he could pursue.

One afternoon a week she gave to him, and arriving late, he usually stayed for dinner and for music afterward.  Those were his red-letter days.  The atmosphere of the house, in such contrast with that in which he lived, and the mere nearness to her, sent him forth each time with a firmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights.  In spite of the beauty in him, and the aching desire to create, it was for her that he struggled.  He was a lover first and always.  All other things he subordinated to love.

Greater than his adventure in the world of thought was his love-adventure.  The world itself was not so amazing because of the atoms and molecules that composed it according to the propulsions of irresistible force; what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth lived in it.  She was the most amazing thing he had ever known, or dreamed, or guessed.

But he was oppressed always by her remoteness.  She was so far from him, and he did not know how to approach her.  He had been a success with girls and women in his own class; but he had never loved any of them, while he did love her, and besides, she was not merely of another class.  His very love elevated her above all classes.  She was a being apart, so far apart that he did not know how to draw near to her as a lover should draw near.  It was true, as he acquired knowledge and language, that he was drawing nearer, talking her speech, discovering ideas and delights in common; but this did not satisfy his lover’s yearning.  His lover’s imagination had made her holy, too holy, too spiritualized, to have any kinship with him in the flesh.  It was his own love that thrust her from him and made her seem impossible for him.  Love itself denied him the one thing that it desired.

And then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged for a moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever narrower.  They had been eating cherries—great, luscious, black cherries with a juice of the color of dark wine.  And later, as she read aloud to him from “The Princess,” he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips.  For the moment her divinity was shattered.  She was clay, after all, mere clay, subject to the common law of clay as his clay was subject, or anybody’s clay.  Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries dyed them as cherries dyed his.  And if so with her lips, then was it so with all of her.  She was woman, all woman, just like any woman.  It came upon him abruptly.  It was a revelation that stunned him.  It was as if he had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had seen worshipped purity polluted.

Then he realized the significance of it, and his heart began pounding and challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain.  He trembled at the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was singing, and reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right.  Something of this change in him must have reached her, for she paused from her reading, looked up at him, and smiled.  His eyes dropped from her blue eyes to her lips, and the sight of the stain maddened him.  His arms all but flashed out to her and around her, in the way of his old careless life.  She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all his will fought to hold him back.

“You were not following a word,” she pouted.

Then she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he looked into her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he felt, he became abashed.  He had indeed in thought dared too far.  Of all the women he had known there was no woman who would not have guessed—save her.  And she had not guessed.  There was the difference.  She was different.  He was appalled by his own grossness, awed by her clear innocence, and he gazed again at her across the gulf.  The bridge had broken down.

But still the incident had brought him nearer.  The memory of it persisted, and in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt upon it eagerly.  The gulf was never again so wide.  He had accomplished a distance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts, or a dozen bachelorships.  She was pure, it was true, as he had never dreamed of purity; but cherries stained her lips.  She was subject to the laws of the universe just as inexorably as he was.  She had to eat to live, and when she got her feet wet, she caught cold.  But that was not the point.  If she could feel hunger and thirst, and heat and cold, then could she feel love—and love for a man.  Well, he was a man.  And why could he not be the man?  “It’s up to me to make good,” he would murmur fervently.  “I will be the man.  I will make myself the man.  I will make good.”

CHAPTER XII

Early one evening, struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the beauty and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain, Martin was called to the telephone.

“It’s a lady’s voice, a fine lady’s,” Mr. Higginbotham, who had called him, jeered.

Martin went to the telephone in the corner of the room, and felt a wave of warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth’s voice.  In his battle with the sonnet he had forgotten her existence, and at the sound of her voice his love for her smote him like a sudden blow.  And such a voice!—delicate and sweet, like a strain of music heard far off and faint, or, better, like a bell of silver, a perfect tone, crystal-pure.  No mere woman had a voice like that.  There was something celestial about it, and it came from other worlds.  He could scarcely hear what it said, so ravished was he, though he controlled his face, for he knew that Mr. Higginbotham’s ferret eyes were fixed upon him.

It was not much that Ruth wanted to say—merely that Norman had been going to take her to a lecture that night, but that he had a headache, and she was so disappointed, and she had the tickets, and that if he had no other engagement, would he be good enough to take her?

Would he!  He fought to suppress the eagerness in his voice.  It was amazing.  He had always seen her in her own house.  And he had never dared to ask her to go anywhere with him.  Quite irrelevantly, still at the telephone and talking with her, he felt an overpowering desire to die for her, and visions of heroic sacrifice shaped and dissolved in his whirling brain.  He loved her so much, so terribly, so hopelessly.  In that moment of mad happiness that she should go out with him, go to a lecture with him—with him, Martin Eden—she soared so far above him that there seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her.  It was the only fit way in which he could express the tremendous and lofty emotion he felt for her.  It was the sublime abnegation of true love that comes to all lovers, and it came to him there, at the telephone, in a whirlwind of fire and glory; and to die for her, he felt, was to have lived and loved well.  And he was only twenty-one, and he had never been in love before.

His hand trembled as he hung up the receiver, and he was weak from the organ which had stirred him.  His eyes were shining like an angel’s, and his face was transfigured, purged of all earthly dross, and pure and holy.

“Makin’ dates outside, eh?” his brother-in-law sneered.  “You know what that means.  You’ll be in the police court yet.”

But Martin could not come down from the height.  Not even the bestiality of the allusion could bring him back to earth.  Anger and hurt were beneath him.  He had seen a great vision and was as a god, and he could feel only profound and awful pity for this maggot of a man.  He did not look at him, and though his eyes passed over him, he did not see him; and as in a dream he passed out of the room to dress.  It was not until he had reached his own room and was tying his necktie that he became aware of a sound that lingered unpleasantly in his ears.  On investigating this sound he identified it as the final snort of Bernard Higginbotham, which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before.

As Ruth’s front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with her, he found himself greatly perturbed.  It was not unalloyed bliss, taking her to the lecture.  He did not know what he ought to do.  He had seen, on the streets, with persons of her class, that the women took the men’s arms.  But then, again, he had seen them when they didn’t; and he wondered if it was only in the evening that arms were taken, or only between husbands and wives and relatives.

Just before he reached the sidewalk, he remembered Minnie.  Minnie had always been a stickler.  She had called him down the second time she walked out with him, because he had gone along on the inside, and she had laid the law down to him that a gentleman always walked on the outside—when he was with a lady.  And Minnie had made a practice of kicking his heels, whenever they crossed from one side of the street to the other, to remind him to get over on the outside.  He wondered where she had got that item of etiquette, and whether it had filtered down from above and was all right.

It wouldn’t do any harm to try it, he decided, by the time they had reached the sidewalk; and he swung behind Ruth and took up his station on the outside.  Then the other problem presented itself.  Should he offer her his arm?  He had never offered anybody his arm in his life.  The girls he had known never took the fellows’ arms.  For the first several times they walked freely, side by side, and after that it was arms around the waists, and heads against the fellows’ shoulders where the streets were unlighted.  But this was different.  She wasn’t that kind of a girl.  He must do something.

He crooked the arm next to her—crooked it very slightly and with secret tentativeness, not invitingly, but just casually, as though he was accustomed to walk that way.  And then the wonderful thing happened.  He felt her hand upon his arm.  Delicious thrills ran through him at the contact, and for a few sweet moments it seemed that he had left the solid earth and was flying with her through the air.  But he was soon back again, perturbed by a new complication.  They were crossing the street.  This would put him on the inside.  He should be on the outside.  Should he therefore drop her arm and change over?  And if he did so, would he have to repeat the manoeuvre the next time?  And the next?  There was something wrong about it, and he resolved not to caper about and play the fool.  Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and when he found himself on the inside, he talked quickly and earnestly, making a show of being carried away by what he was saying, so that, in case he was wrong in not changing sides, his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness.

As they crossed Broadway, he came face to face with a new problem.  In the blaze of the electric lights, he saw Lizzie Connolly and her giggly friend.  Only for an instant he hesitated, then his hand went up and his hat came off.  He could not be disloyal to his kind, and it was to more than Lizzie Connolly that his hat was lifted.  She nodded and looked at him boldly, not with soft and gentle eyes like Ruth’s, but with eyes that were handsome and hard, and that swept on past him to Ruth and itemized her face and dress and station.  And he was aware that Ruth looked, too, with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a dove’s, but which saw, in a look that was a flutter on and past, the working-class girl in her cheap finery and under the strange hat that all working-class girls were wearing just then.

“What a pretty girl!” Ruth said a moment later.

Martin could have blessed her, though he said:-

“I don’t know.  I guess it’s all a matter of personal taste, but she doesn’t strike me as being particularly pretty.”

“Why, there isn’t one woman in ten thousand with features as regular as hers.  They are splendid.  Her face is as clear-cut as a cameo.  And her eyes are beautiful.”

“Do you think so?” Martin queried absently, for to him there was only one beautiful woman in the world, and she was beside him, her hand upon his arm.

“Do I think so?  If that girl had proper opportunity to dress, Mr. Eden, and if she were taught how to carry herself, you would be fairly dazzled by her, and so would all men.”

“She would have to be taught how to speak,” he commented, “or else most of the men wouldn’t understand her.  I’m sure you couldn’t understand a quarter of what she said if she just spoke naturally.”

“Nonsense!  You are as bad as Arthur when you try to make your point.”

“You forget how I talked when you first met me.  I have learned a new language since then.  Before that time I talked as that girl talks.  Now I can manage to make myself understood sufficiently in your language to explain that you do not know that other girl’s language.  And do you know why she carries herself the way she does?  I think about such things now, though I never used to think about them, and I am beginning to understand—much.”

“But why does she?”

“She has worked long hours for years at machines.  When one’s body is young, it is very pliable, and hard work will mould it like putty according to the nature of the work.  I can tell at a glance the trades of many workingmen I meet on the street.  Look at me.  Why am I rolling all about the shop?  Because of the years I put in on the sea.  If I’d put in the same years cow-punching, with my body young and pliable, I wouldn’t be rolling now, but I’d be bow-legged.  And so with that girl.  You noticed that her eyes were what I might call hard.  She has never been sheltered.  She has had to take care of herself, and a young girl can’t take care of herself and keep her eyes soft and gentle like—like yours, for example.”

“I think you are right,” Ruth said in a low voice.  “And it is too bad.  She is such a pretty girl.”

He looked at her and saw her eyes luminous with pity.  And then he remembered that he loved her and was lost in amazement at his fortune that permitted him to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture.

Who are you, Martin Eden? he demanded of himself in the looking-glass, that night when he got back to his room.  He gazed at himself long and curiously.  Who are you?  What are you?  Where do you belong?  You belong by rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly.  You belong with the legions of toil, with all that is low, and vulgar, and unbeautiful.  You belong with the oxen and the drudges, in dirty surroundings among smells and stenches.  There are the stale vegetables now.  Those potatoes are rotting.  Smell them, damn you, smell them.  And yet you dare to open the books, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful paintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars!  Who are you? and what are you? damn you!  And are you going to make good?

He shook his fist at himself in the glass, and sat down on the edge of the bed to dream for a space with wide eyes.  Then he got out note-book and algebra and lost himself in quadratic equations, while the hours slipped by, and the stars dimmed, and the gray of dawn flooded against his window.

CHAPTER XIII

It was the knot of wordy socialists and working-class philosophers that held forth in the City Hall Park on warm afternoons that was responsible for the great discovery.  Once or twice in the month, while riding through the park on his way to the library, Martin dismounted from his wheel and listened to the arguments, and each time he tore himself away reluctantly.  The tone of discussion was much lower than at Mr. Morse’s table.  The men were not grave and dignified.  They lost their tempers easily and called one another names, while oaths and obscene allusions were frequent on their lips.  Once or twice he had seen them come to blows.  And yet, he knew not why, there seemed something vital about the stuff of these men’s thoughts.  Their logomachy was far more stimulating to his intellect than the reserved and quiet dogmatism of Mr. Morse.  These men, who slaughtered English, gesticulated like lunatics, and fought one another’s ideas with primitive anger, seemed somehow to be more alive than Mr. Morse and his crony, Mr. Butler.

Martin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park, but one afternoon a disciple of Spencer’s appeared, a seedy tramp with a dirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a shirt.  Battle royal was waged, amid the smoking of many cigarettes and the expectoration of much tobacco-juice, wherein the tramp successfully held his own, even when a socialist workman sneered, “There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.”  Martin was puzzled as to what the discussion was about, but when he rode on to the library he carried with him a new-born interest in Herbert Spencer, and because of the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned “First Principles,” Martin drew out that volume.

So the great discovery began.  Once before he had tried Spencer, and choosing the “Principles of Psychology” to begin with, he had failed as abjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky.  There had been no understanding the book, and he had returned it unread.  But this night, after algebra and physics, and an attempt at a sonnet, he got into bed and opened “First Principles.”  Morning found him still reading.  It was impossible for him to sleep.  Nor did he write that day.  He lay on the bed till his body grew tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on his back, the book held in the air above him, or changing from side to side.  He slept that night, and did his writing next morning, and then the book tempted him and he fell, reading all afternoon, oblivious to everything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon Ruth gave to him.  His first consciousness of the immediate world about him was when Bernard Higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know if he thought they were running a restaurant.

Martin Eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days.  He wanted to know, and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the world.  But he was now learning from Spencer that he never had known, and that he never could have known had he continued his sailing and wandering forever.  He had merely skimmed over the surface of things, observing detached phenomena, accumulating fragments of facts, making superficial little generalizations—and all and everything quite unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance.  The mechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about with understanding; but it had never entered his head to try to explain the process whereby birds, as organic flying mechanisms, had been developed.  He had never dreamed there was such a process.  That birds should have come to be, was unguessed.  They always had been.  They just happened.

And as it was with birds, so had it been with everything.  His ignorant and unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless.  The medieval metaphysics of Kant had given him the key to nothing, and had served the sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers.  In similar manner his attempt to study evolution had been confined to a hopelessly technical volume by Romanes.  He had understood nothing, and the only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a dry-as-dust theory, of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible vocabularies.  And now he learned that evolution was no mere theory but an accepted process of development; that scientists no longer disagreed about it, their only differences being over the method of evolution.

And here was the man Spencer, organizing all knowledge for him, reducing everything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities, and presenting to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles.  There was no caprice, no chance.  All was law.  It was in obedience to law that the bird flew, and it was in obedience to the same law that fermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out legs and wings and become a bird.

Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and here he was at a higher pitch than ever.  All the hidden things were laying their secrets bare.  He was drunken with comprehension.  At night, asleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the day, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon the world he had just discovered.  At table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him.  In the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun shining in his brain.  He was entranced by illumination, and did not hear the “Bughouse,” whispered by Jim, nor see the anxiety on his sister’s face, nor notice the rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham’s finger, whereby he imparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brother-in-law’s head.

What, in a way, most profoundly impressed Martin, was the correlation of knowledge—of all knowledge.  He had been curious to know things, and whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in his brain.  Thus, on the subject of sailing he had an immense store.  On the subject of woman he had a fairly large store.  But these two subjects had been unrelated.  Between the two memory compartments there had been no connection.  That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible.  But Herbert Spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous, but that it was impossible for there to be no connection.  All things were related to all other things from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the grain of sand under one’s foot.  This new concept was a perpetual amazement to Martin, and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side of the sun.  He drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all—kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes, rainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions, illuminating gas, cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and tobacco.  Thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it, or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal, but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know.  And the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the universe, and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.

“You fool!” he cried at his image in the looking-glass.  “You wanted to write, and you tried to write, and you had nothing in you to write about.  What did you have in you?—some childish notions, a few half-baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass of ignorance, a heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance.  And you wanted to write!  Why, you’re just on the edge of beginning to get something in you to write about.  You wanted to create beauty, but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature of beauty?  You wanted to write about life when you knew nothing of the essential characteristics of life.  You wanted to write about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a Chinese puzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of existence.  But cheer up, Martin, my boy.  You’ll write yet.  You know a little, a very little, and you’re on the right road now to know more.  Some day, if you’re lucky, you may come pretty close to knowing all that may be known.  Then you will write.”

He brought his great discovery to Ruth, sharing with her all his joy and wonder in it.  But she did not seem to be so enthusiastic over it.  She tacitly accepted it and, in a way, seemed aware of it from her own studies.  It did not stir her deeply, as it did him, and he would have been surprised had he not reasoned it out that it was not new and fresh to her as it was to him.  Arthur and Norman, he found, believed in evolution and had read Spencer, though it did not seem to have made any vital impression upon them, while the young fellow with the glasses and the mop of hair, Will Olney, sneered disagreeably at Spencer and repeated the epigram, “There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.”

But Martin forgave him the sneer, for he had begun to discover that Olney was not in love with Ruth.  Later, he was dumfounded to learn from various little happenings not only that Olney did not care for Ruth, but that he had a positive dislike for her.  Martin could not understand this.  It was a bit of phenomena that he could not correlate with all the rest of the phenomena in the universe.  But nevertheless he felt sorry for the young fellow because of the great lack in his nature that prevented him from a proper appreciation of Ruth’s fineness and beauty.  They rode out into the hills several Sundays on their wheels, and Martin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed between Ruth and Olney.  The latter chummed with Norman, throwing Arthur and Martin into company with Ruth, for which Martin was duly grateful.

Those Sundays were great days for Martin, greatest because he was with Ruth, and great, also, because they were putting him more on a par with the young men of her class.  In spite of their long years of disciplined education, he was finding himself their intellectual equal, and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had studied so hard.  He had abandoned the etiquette books, falling back upon observation to show him the right things to do.  Except when carried away by his enthusiasm, he was always on guard, keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little courtesies and refinements of conduct.

The fact that Spencer was very little read was for some time a source of surprise to Martin.  “Herbert Spencer,” said the man at the desk in the library, “oh, yes, a great mind.”  But the man did not seem to know anything of the content of that great mind.  One evening, at dinner, when Mr. Butler was there, Martin turned the conversation upon Spencer.  Mr. Morse bitterly arraigned the English philosopher’s agnosticism, but confessed that he had not read “First Principles”; while Mr. Butler stated that he had no patience with Spencer, had never read a line of him, and had managed to get along quite well without him.  Doubts arose in Martin’s mind, and had he been less strongly individual he would have accepted the general opinion and given Herbert Spencer up.  As it was, he found Spencer’s explanation of things convincing; and, as he phrased it to himself, to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a navigator throwing the compass and chronometer overboard.  So Martin went on into a thorough study of evolution, mastering more and more the subject himself, and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of a thousand independent writers.  The more he studied, the more vistas he caught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored, and the regret that days were only twenty-four hours long became a chronic complaint with him.

One day, because the days were so short, he decided to give up algebra and geometry.  Trigonometry he had not even attempted.  Then he cut chemistry from his study-list, retaining only physics.

“I am not a specialist,” he said, in defence, to Ruth.  “Nor am I going to try to be a specialist.  There are too many special fields for any one man, in a whole lifetime, to master a tithe of them.  I must pursue general knowledge.  When I need the work of specialists, I shall refer to their books.”

“But that is not like having the knowledge yourself,” she protested.

“But it is unnecessary to have it.  We profit from the work of the specialists.  That’s what they are for.  When I came in, I noticed the chimney-sweeps at work.  They’re specialists, and when they get done, you will enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the construction of chimneys.”

“That’s far-fetched, I am afraid.”

She looked at him curiously, and he felt a reproach in her gaze and manner.  But he was convinced of the rightness of his position.

“All thinkers on general subjects, the greatest minds in the world, in fact, rely on the specialists.  Herbert Spencer did that.  He generalized upon the findings of thousands of investigators.  He would have had to live a thousand lives in order to do it all himself.  And so with Darwin.  He took advantage of all that had been learned by the florists and cattle-breeders.”

“You’re right, Martin,” Olney said.  “You know what you’re after, and Ruth doesn’t.  She doesn’t know what she is after for herself even.”

“—Oh, yes,” Olney rushed on, heading off her objection, “I know you call it general culture.  But it doesn’t matter what you study if you want general culture.  You can study French, or you can study German, or cut them both out and study Esperanto, you’ll get the culture tone just the same.  You can study Greek or Latin, too, for the same purpose, though it will never be any use to you.  It will be culture, though.  Why, Ruth studied Saxon, became clever in it,—that was two years ago,—and all that she remembers of it now is ‘Whan that sweet Aprile with his schowers soote’—isn’t that the way it goes?”

“But it’s given you the culture tone just the same,” he laughed, again heading her off.  “I know.  We were in the same classes.”

“But you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something,” Ruth cried out.  Her eyes were flashing, and in her cheeks were two spots of color.  “Culture is the end in itself.”

“But that is not what Martin wants.”

“How do you know?”

“What do you want, Martin?” Olney demanded, turning squarely upon him.

Martin felt very uncomfortable, and looked entreaty at Ruth.

“Yes, what do you want?” Ruth asked.  “That will settle it.”

“Yes, of course, I want culture,” Martin faltered.  “I love beauty, and culture will give me a finer and keener appreciation of beauty.”

She nodded her head and looked triumph.

“Rot, and you know it,” was Olney’s comment.  “Martin’s after career, not culture.  It just happens that culture, in his case, is incidental to career.  If he wanted to be a chemist, culture would be unnecessary.  Martin wants to write, but he’s afraid to say so because it will put you in the wrong.”

“And why does Martin want to write?” he went on.  “Because he isn’t rolling in wealth.  Why do you fill your head with Saxon and general culture?  Because you don’t have to make your way in the world.  Your father sees to that.  He buys your clothes for you, and all the rest.  What rotten good is our education, yours and mine and Arthur’s and Norman’s?  We’re soaked in general culture, and if our daddies went broke to-day, we’d be falling down to-morrow on teachers’ examinations.  The best job you could get, Ruth, would be a country school or music teacher in a girls’ boarding-school.”

“And pray what would you do?” she asked.

“Not a blessed thing.  I could earn a dollar and a half a day, common labor, and I might get in as instructor in Hanley’s cramming joint—I say might, mind you, and I might be chucked out at the end of the week for sheer inability.”

Martin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced that Olney was right, he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded Ruth.  A new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened.  Reason had nothing to do with love.  It mattered not whether the woman he loved reasoned correctly or incorrectly.  Love was above reason.  If it just happened that she did not fully appreciate his necessity for a career, that did not make her a bit less lovable.  She was all lovable, and what she thought had nothing to do with her lovableness.

“What’s that?” he replied to a question from Olney that broke in upon his train of thought.

“I was saying that I hoped you wouldn’t be fool enough to tackle Latin.”

“But Latin is more than culture,” Ruth broke in.  “It is equipment.”

“Well, are you going to tackle it?” Olney persisted.

Martin was sore beset.  He could see that Ruth was hanging eagerly upon his answer.

“I am afraid I won’t have time,” he said finally.  “I’d like to, but I won’t have time.”

“You see, Martin’s not seeking culture,” Olney exulted.  “He’s trying to get somewhere, to do something.”

“Oh, but it’s mental training.  It’s mind discipline.  It’s what makes disciplined minds.”  Ruth looked expectantly at Martin, as if waiting for him to change his judgment.  “You know, the foot-ball players have to train before the big game.  And that is what Latin does for the thinker.  It trains.”

“Rot and bosh!  That’s what they told us when we were kids.  But there is one thing they didn’t tell us then.  They let us find it out for ourselves afterwards.”  Olney paused for effect, then added, “And what they didn’t tell us was that every gentleman should have studied Latin, but that no gentleman should know Latin.”

“Now that’s unfair,” Ruth cried.  “I knew you were turning the conversation just in order to get off something.”

“It’s clever all right,” was the retort, “but it’s fair, too.  The only men who know their Latin are the apothecaries, the lawyers, and the Latin professors.  And if Martin wants to be one of them, I miss my guess.  But what’s all that got to do with Herbert Spencer anyway?  Martin’s just discovered Spencer, and he’s wild over him.  Why?  Because Spencer is taking him somewhere.  Spencer couldn’t take me anywhere, nor you.  We haven’t got anywhere to go.  You’ll get married some day, and I’ll have nothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business agents who will take care of the money my father’s going to leave me.”

Onley got up to go, but turned at the door and delivered a parting shot.

“You leave Martin alone, Ruth.  He knows what’s best for himself.  Look at what he’s done already.  He makes me sick sometimes, sick and ashamed of myself.  He knows more now about the world, and life, and man’s place, and all the rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for that matter, and in spite of all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and culture.”

“But Ruth is my teacher,” Martin answered chivalrously.  “She is responsible for what little I have learned.”

“Rats!”  Olney looked at Ruth, and his expression was malicious.  “I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you read Spencer on her recommendation—only you didn’t.  And she doesn’t know anything more about Darwin and evolution than I do about King Solomon’s mines.  What’s that jawbreaker definition about something or other, of Spencer’s, that you sprang on us the other day—that indefinite, incoherent homogeneity thing?  Spring it on her, and see if she understands a word of it.  That isn’t culture, you see.  Well, tra la, and if you tackle Latin, Martin, I won’t have any respect for you.”

And all the while, interested in the discussion, Martin had been aware of an irk in it as well.  It was about studies and lessons, dealing with the rudiments of knowledge, and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted with the big things that were stirring in him—with the grip upon life that was even then crooking his fingers like eagle’s talons, with the cosmic thrills that made him ache, and with the inchoate consciousness of mastery of it all.  He likened himself to a poet, wrecked on the shores of a strange land, filled with power of beauty, stumbling and stammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough, barbaric tongue of his brethren in the new land.  And so with him.  He was alive, painfully alive, to the great universal things, and yet he was compelled to potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he should study Latin.

“What in hell has Latin to do with it?” he demanded before his mirror that night.  “I wish dead people would stay dead.  Why should I and the beauty in me be ruled by the dead?  Beauty is alive and everlasting.  Languages come and go.  They are the dust of the dead.”

And his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well, and he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion when he was with Ruth.  He was only a schoolboy, with a schoolboy’s tongue, when he was in her presence.

“Give me time,” he said aloud.  “Only give me time.”

Time!  Time!  Time! was his unending plaint.

CHAPTER XIV

It was not because of Olney, but in spite of Ruth, and his love for Ruth, that he finally decided not to take up Latin.  His money meant time.  There was so much that was more important than Latin, so many studies that clamored with imperious voices.  And he must write.  He must earn money.  He had had no acceptances.  Twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the endless round of the magazines.  How did the others do it?  He spent long hours in the free reading-room, going over what others had written, studying their work eagerly and critically, comparing it with his own, and wondering, wondering, about the secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work.

He was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead.  No light, no life, no color, was shot through it.  There was no breath of life in it, and yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars a thousand—the newspaper clipping had said so.  He was puzzled by countless short stories, written lightly and cleverly he confessed, but without vitality or reality.  Life was so strange and wonderful, filled with an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils, and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life.  He felt the stress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild insurgences—surely this was the stuff to write about!  He wanted to glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the giants that fought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy, making life crackle with the strength of their endeavor.  And yet the magazine short stories seemed intent on glorifying the Mr. Butlers, the sordid dollar-chasers, and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace little men and women.  Was it because the editors of the magazines were commonplace? he demanded.  Or were they afraid of life, these writers and editors and readers?

But his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers.  And not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody who had ever attempted to write.  There was nobody to tell him, to hint to him, to give him the least word of advice.  He began to doubt that editors were real men.  They seemed cogs in a machine.  That was what it was, a machine.  He poured his soul into stories, articles, and poems, and intrusted them to the machine.  He folded them just so, put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript, sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the mail-box.  It travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed.  There was no human editor at the other end, but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps.  It was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate.  It depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got chocolate or gum.  And so with the editorial machine.  One slot brought checks and the other brought rejection slips.  So far he had found only the latter slot.

It was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness of the process.  These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had received hundreds of them—as many as a dozen or more on each of his earlier manuscripts.  If he had received one line, one personal line, along with one rejection of all his rejections, he would have been cheered.  But not one editor had given that proof of existence.  And he could conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end, only mere cogs, well oiled and running beautifully in the machine.

He was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have been content to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was bleeding to death, and not years but weeks would determine the fight.  Each week his board bill brought him nearer destruction, while the postage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely.  He no longer bought books, and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the inevitable end; though he did not know how to economize, and brought the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister Marian five dollars for a dress.

He struggled in the dark, without advice, without encouragement, and in the teeth of discouragement.  Even Gertrude was beginning to look askance.  At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she conceived to be his foolishness; but now, out of sisterly solicitude, she grew anxious.  To her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming a madness.  Martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than from the open and nagging contempt of Bernard Higginbotham.  Martin had faith in himself, but he was alone in this faith.  Not even Ruth had faith.  She had wanted him to devote himself to study, and, though she had not openly disapproved of his writing, she had never approved.

He had never offered to show her his work.  A fastidious delicacy had prevented him.  Besides, she had been studying heavily at the university, and he felt averse to robbing her of her time.  But when she had taken her degree, she asked him herself to let her see something of what he had been doing.  Martin was elated and diffident.  Here was a judge.  She was a bachelor of arts.  She had studied literature under skilled instructors.  Perhaps the editors were capable judges, too.  But she would be different from them.  She would not hand him a stereotyped rejection slip, nor would she inform him that lack of preference for his work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work.  She would talk, a warm human being, in her quick, bright way, and, most important of all, she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden.  In his work she would discern what his heart and soul were like, and she would come to understand something, a little something, of the stuff of his dreams and the strength of his power.

Martin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short stories, hesitated a moment, then added his “Sea Lyrics.”  They mounted their wheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills.  It was the second time he had been out with her alone, and as they rode along through the balmy warmth, just chilled by she sea-breeze to refreshing coolness, he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very beautiful and well-ordered world and that it was good to be alive and to love.  They left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to the brown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest breath of dry sweetness and content.

“Its work is done,” Martin said, as they seated themselves, she upon his coat, and he sprawling close to the warm earth.  He sniffed the sweetness of the tawny grass, which entered his brain and set his thoughts whirling on from the particular to the universal.  “It has achieved its reason for existence,” he went on, patting the dry grass affectionately.  “It quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter, fought the violent early spring, flowered, and lured the insects and the bees, scattered its seeds, squared itself with its duty and the world, and—”

“Why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical eyes?” she interrupted.

“Because I’ve been studying evolution, I guess.  It’s only recently that I got my eyesight, if the truth were told.”

“But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical, that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the down off their beautiful wings.”

He shook his head.

“Beauty has significance, but I never knew its significance before.  I just accepted beauty as something meaningless, as something that was just beautiful without rhyme or reason.  I did not know anything about beauty.  But now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to know.  This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass, and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass.  Why, there is romance in the life-history of any grass, yes, and adventure, too.  The very thought of it stirs me.  When I think of the play of force and matter, and all the tremendous struggle of it, I feel as if I could write an epic on the grass.

“How well you talk,” she said absently, and he noted that she was looking at him in a searching way.

He was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant, the blood flushing red on his neck and brow.

“I hope I am learning to talk,” he stammered.  “There seems to be so much in me I want to say.  But it is all so big.  I can’t find ways to say what is really in me.  Sometimes it seems to me that all the world, all life, everything, had taken up residence inside of me and was clamoring for me to be the spokesman.  I feel—oh, I can’t describe it—I feel the bigness of it, but when I speak, I babble like a little child.  It is a great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech, written or spoken, that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens, transmute itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation.  It is a lordly task.  See, I bury my face in the grass, and the breath I draw in through my nostrils sets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and fancies.  It is a breath of the universe I have breathed.  I know song and laughter, and success and pain, and struggle and death; and I see visions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass, and I would like to tell them to you, to the world.  But how can I?  My tongue is tied.  I have tried, by the spoken word, just now, to describe to you the effect on me of the scent of the grass.  But I have not succeeded.  I have no more than hinted in awkward speech.  My words seem gibberish to me.  And yet I am stifled with desire to tell.  Oh!—” he threw up his hands with a despairing gesture—“it is impossible!  It is not understandable!  It is incommunicable!”

“But you do talk well,” she insisted.  “Just think how you have improved in the short time I have known you.  Mr. Butler is a noted public speaker.  He is always asked by the State Committee to go out on stump during campaign.  Yet you talked just as well as he the other night at dinner.  Only he was more controlled.  You get too excited; but you will get over that with practice.  Why, you would make a good public speaker.  You can go far—if you want to.  You are masterly.  You can lead men, I am sure, and there is no reason why you should not succeed at anything you set your hand to, just as you have succeeded with grammar.  You would make a good lawyer.  You should shine in politics.  There is nothing to prevent you from making as great a success as Mr. Butler has made.  And minus the dyspepsia,” she added with a smile.

They talked on; she, in her gently persistent way, returning always to the need of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages of Latin as part of the foundation for any career.  She drew her ideal of the successful man, and it was largely in her father’s image, with a few unmistakable lines and touches of color from the image of Mr. Butler.  He listened eagerly, with receptive ears, lying on his back and looking up and joying in each movement of her lips as she talked.  But his brain was not receptive.  There was nothing alluring in the pictures she drew, and he was aware of a dull pain of disappointment and of a sharper ache of love for her.  In all she said there was no mention of his writing, and the manuscripts he had brought to read lay neglected on the ground.

At last, in a pause, he glanced at the sun, measured its height above the horizon, and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up.

“I had forgotten,” she said quickly.  “And I am so anxious to hear.”

He read to her a story, one that he flattered himself was among his very best.  He called it “The Wine of Life,” and the wine of it, that had stolen into his brain when he wrote it, stole into his brain now as he read it.  There was a certain magic in the original conception, and he had adorned it with more magic of phrase and touch.  All the old fire and passion with which he had written it were reborn in him, and he was swayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of it.  But it was not so with Ruth.  Her trained ear detected the weaknesses and exaggerations, the overemphasis of the tyro, and she was instantly aware each time the sentence-rhythm tripped and faltered.  She scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise, except when it became too pompous, at which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its amateurishness.  That was her final judgment on the story as a whole—amateurish, though she did not tell him so.  Instead, when he had done, she pointed out the minor flaws and said that she liked the story.

But he was disappointed.  Her criticism was just.  He acknowledged that, but he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her for the purpose of schoolroom correction.  The details did not matter.  They could take care of themselves.  He could mend them, he could learn to mend them.  Out of life he had captured something big and attempted to imprison it in the story.  It was the big thing out of life he had read to her, not sentence-structure and semicolons.  He wanted her to feel with him this big thing that was his, that he had seen with his own eyes, grappled with his own brain, and placed there on the page with his own hands in printed words.  Well, he had failed, was his secret decision.  Perhaps the editors were right.  He had felt the big thing, but he had failed to transmute it.  He concealed his disappointment, and joined so easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep down in him was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement.

“This next thing I’ve called ‘The Pot’,” he said, unfolding the manuscript.  “It has been refused by four or five magazines now, but still I think it is good.  In fact, I don’t know what to think of it, except that I’ve caught something there.  Maybe it won’t affect you as it does me.  It’s a short thing—only two thousand words.”

“How dreadful!” she cried, when he had finished.  “It is horrible, unutterably horrible!”

He noted her pale face, her eyes wide and tense, and her clenched hands, with secret satisfaction.  He had succeeded.  He had communicated the stuff of fancy and feeling from out of his brain.  It had struck home.  No matter whether she liked it or not, it had gripped her and mastered her, made her sit there and listen and forget details.

“It is life,” he said, “and life is not always beautiful.  And yet, perhaps because I am strangely made, I find something beautiful there.  It seems to me that the beauty is tenfold enhanced because it is there—”

“But why couldn’t the poor woman—” she broke in disconnectedly.  Then she left the revolt of her thought unexpressed to cry out: “Oh!  It is degrading!  It is not nice!  It is nasty!”

For the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still.  Nasty!  He had never dreamed it.  He had not meant it.  The whole sketch stood before him in letters of fire, and in such blaze of illumination he sought vainly for nastiness.  Then his heart began to beat again.  He was not guilty.

“Why didn’t you select a nice subject?” she was saying.  “We know there are nasty things in the world, but that is no reason—”

She talked on in her indignant strain, but he was not following her.  He was smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face, so innocent, so penetratingly innocent, that its purity seemed always to enter into him, driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some ethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine.  We know there are nasty things in the world!  He cuddled to him the notion of her knowing, and chuckled over it as a love joke.  The next moment, in a flashing vision of multitudinous detail, he sighted the whole sea of life’s nastiness that he had known and voyaged over and through, and he forgave her for not understanding the story.  It was through no fault of hers that she could not understand.  He thanked God that she had been born and sheltered to such innocence.  But he knew life, its foulness as well as its fairness, its greatness in spite of the slime that infested it, and by God he was going to have his say on it to the world.  Saints in heaven—how could they be anything but fair and pure?  No praise to them.  But saints in slime—ah, that was the everlasting wonder!  That was what made life worth while.  To see moral grandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity; to rise himself and first glimpse beauty, faint and far, through mud-dripping eyes; to see out of weakness, and frailty, and viciousness, and all abysmal brutishness, arising strength, and truth, and high spiritual endowment—

He caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering.

“The tone of it all is low.  And there is so much that is high.  Take ‘In Memoriam.’”

He was impelled to suggest “Locksley Hall,” and would have done so, had not his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her, the female of his kind, who, out of the primordial ferment, creeping and crawling up the vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries, had emerged on the topmost rung, having become one Ruth, pure, and fair, and divine, and with power to make him know love, and to aspire toward purity, and to desire to taste divinity—him, Martin Eden, who, too, had come up in some amazing fashion from out of the ruck and the mire and the countless mistakes and abortions of unending creation.  There was the romance, and the wonder, and the glory.  There was the stuff to write, if he could only find speech.  Saints in heaven!—They were only saints and could not help themselves.  But he was a man.

“You have strength,” he could hear her saying, “but it is untutored strength.”

“Like a bull in a china shop,” he suggested, and won a smile.

“And you must develop discrimination.  You must consult taste, and fineness, and tone.”

“I dare too much,” he muttered.

She smiled approbation, and settled herself to listen to another story.

“I don’t know what you’ll make of this,” he said apologetically.  “It’s a funny thing.  I’m afraid I got beyond my depth in it, but my intentions were good.  Don’t bother about the little features of it.  Just see if you catch the feel of the big thing in it.  It is big, and it is true, though the chance is large that I have failed to make it intelligible.”

He read, and as he read he watched her.  At last he had reached her, he thought.  She sat without movement, her eyes steadfast upon him, scarcely breathing, caught up and out of herself, he thought, by the witchery of the thing he had created.  He had entitled the story “Adventure,” and it was the apotheosis of adventure—not of the adventure of the storybooks, but of real adventure, the savage taskmaster, awful of punishment and awful of reward, faithless and whimsical, demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and nights of toil, offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at the end of thirst and famine or of the long drag and monstrous delirium of rotting fever, through blood and sweat and stinging insects leading up by long chains of petty and ignoble contacts to royal culminations and lordly achievements.

It was this, all of it, and more, that he had put into his story, and it was this, he believed, that warmed her as she sat and listened.  Her eyes were wide, color was in her pale cheeks, and before he finished it seemed to him that she was almost panting.  Truly, she was warmed; but she was warmed, not by the story, but by him.  She did not think much of the story; it was Martin’s intensity of power, the old excess of strength that seemed to pour from his body and on and over her.  The paradox of it was that it was the story itself that was freighted with his power, that was the channel, for the time being, through which his strength poured out to her.  She was aware only of the strength, and not of the medium, and when she seemed most carried away by what he had written, in reality she had been carried away by something quite foreign to it—by a thought, terrible and perilous, that had formed itself unsummoned in her brain.  She had caught herself wondering what marriage was like, and the becoming conscious of the waywardness and ardor of the thought had terrified her.  It was unmaidenly.  It was not like her.  She had never been tormented by womanhood, and she had lived in a dreamland of Tennysonian poesy, dense even to the full significance of that delicate master’s delicate allusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens and knights.  She had been asleep, always, and now life was thundering imperatively at all her doors.  Mentally she was in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop the bars into place, while wanton instincts urged her to throw wide her portals and bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter in.

Martin waited with satisfaction for her verdict.  He had no doubt of what it would be, and he was astounded when he heard her say:

“It is beautiful.”

“It is beautiful,” she repeated, with emphasis, after a pause.

Of course it was beautiful; but there was something more than mere beauty in it, something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its handmaiden.  He sprawled silently on the ground, watching the grisly form of a great doubt rising before him.  He had failed.  He was inarticulate.  He had seen one of the greatest things in the world, and he had not expressed it.

“What did you think of the—”  He hesitated, abashed at his first attempt to use a strange word.  “Of the motif?” he asked.

“It was confused,” she answered.  “That is my only criticism in the large way.  I followed the story, but there seemed so much else.  It is too wordy.  You clog the action by introducing so much extraneous material.”

“That was the major motif,” he hurriedly explained, “the big underrunning motif, the cosmic and universal thing.  I tried to make it keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all.  I was on the right scent, but I guess I did it badly.  I did not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at.  But I’ll learn in time.”

She did not follow him.  She was a bachelor of arts, but he had gone beyond her limitations.  This she did not comprehend, attributing her incomprehension to his incoherence.

“You were too voluble,” she said.  “But it was beautiful, in places.”

He heard her voice as from far off, for he was debating whether he would read her the “Sea Lyrics.”  He lay in dull despair, while she watched him searchingly, pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward thoughts of marriage.

“You want to be famous?” she asked abruptly.

“Yes, a little bit,” he confessed.  “That is part of the adventure.  It is not the being famous, but the process of becoming so, that counts.  And after all, to be famous would be, for me, only a means to something else.  I want to be famous very much, for that matter, and for that reason.”

“For your sake,” he wanted to add, and might have added had she proved enthusiastic over what he had read to her.

But she was too busy in her mind, carving out a career for him that would at least be possible, to ask what the ultimate something was which he had hinted at.  There was no career for him in literature.  Of that she was convinced.  He had proved it to-day, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.  He could talk well, but he was incapable of expressing himself in a literary way.  She compared Tennyson, and Browning, and her favorite prose masters with him, and to his hopeless discredit.  Yet she did not tell him her whole mind.  Her strange interest in him led her to temporize.  His desire to write was, after all, a little weakness which he would grow out of in time.  Then he would devote himself to the more serious affairs of life.  And he would succeed, too.  She knew that.  He was so strong that he could not fail—if only he would drop writing.

“I wish you would show me all you write, Mr. Eden,” she said.

He flushed with pleasure.  She was interested, that much was sure.  And at least she had not given him a rejection slip.  She had called certain portions of his work beautiful, and that was the first encouragement he had ever received from any one.

“I will,” he said passionately.  “And I promise you, Miss Morse, that I will make good.  I have come far, I know that; and I have far to go, and I will cover it if I have to do it on my hands and knees.”  He held up a bunch of manuscript.  “Here are the ‘Sea Lyrics.’  When you get home, I’ll turn them over to you to read at your leisure.  And you must be sure to tell me just what you think of them.  What I need, you know, above all things, is criticism.  And do, please, be frank with me.”

“I will be perfectly frank,” she promised, with an uneasy conviction that she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could be quite frank with him the next time.

CHAPTER XV

“The first battle, fought and finished,” Martin said to the looking-glass ten days later.  “But there will be a second battle, and a third battle, and battles to the end of time, unless—”

He had not finished the sentence, but looked about the mean little room and let his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts, still in their long envelopes, which lay in a corner on the floor.  He had no stamps with which to continue them on their travels, and for a week they had been piling up.  More of them would come in on the morrow, and on the next day, and the next, till they were all in.  And he would be unable to start them out again.  He was a month’s rent behind on the typewriter, which he could not pay, having barely enough for the week’s board which was due and for the employment office fees.

He sat down and regarded the table thoughtfully.  There were ink stains upon it, and he suddenly discovered that he was fond of it.

“Dear old table,” he said, “I’ve spent some happy hours with you, and you’ve been a pretty good friend when all is said and done.  You never turned me down, never passed me out a reward-of-unmerit rejection slip, never complained about working overtime.”

He dropped his arms upon the table and buried his face in them.  His throat was aching, and he wanted to cry.  It reminded him of his first fight, when he was six years old, when he punched away with the tears running down his cheeks while the other boy, two years his elder, had beaten and pounded him into exhaustion.  He saw the ring of boys, howling like barbarians as he went down at last, writhing in the throes of nausea, the blood streaming from his nose and the tears from his bruised eyes.

“Poor little shaver,” he murmured.  “And you’re just as badly licked now.  You’re beaten to a pulp.  You’re down and out.”

But the vision of that first fight still lingered under his eyelids, and as he watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of fights which had followed.  Six months later Cheese-Face (that was the boy) had whipped him again.  But he had blacked Cheese-Face’s eye that time.  That was going some.  He saw them all, fight after fight, himself always whipped and Cheese-Face exulting over him.  But he had never run away.  He felt strengthened by the memory of that.  He had always stayed and taken his medicine.  Cheese-Face had been a little fiend at fighting, and had never once shown mercy to him.  But he had stayed!  He had stayed with it!

Next, he saw a narrow alley, between ramshackle frame buildings.  The end of the alley was blocked by a one-story brick building, out of which issued the rhythmic thunder of the presses, running off the first edition of the Enquirer.  He was eleven, and Cheese-Face was thirteen, and they both carried the Enquirer.  That was why they were there, waiting for their papers.  And, of course, Cheese-Face had picked on him again, and there was another fight that was indeterminate, because at quarter to four the door of the press-room was thrown open and the gang of boys crowded in to fold their papers.

“I’ll lick you to-morrow,” he heard Cheese-Face promise; and he heard his own voice, piping and trembling with unshed tears, agreeing to be there on the morrow.

And he had come there the next day, hurrying from school to be there first, and beating Cheese-Face by two minutes.  The other boys said he was all right, and gave him advice, pointing out his faults as a scrapper and promising him victory if he carried out their instructions.  The same boys gave Cheese-Face advice, too.  How they had enjoyed the fight!  He paused in his recollections long enough to envy them the spectacle he and Cheese-Face had put up.  Then the fight was on, and it went on, without rounds, for thirty minutes, until the press-room door was opened.

He watched the youthful apparition of himself, day after day, hurrying from school to the Enquirer alley.  He could not walk very fast.  He was stiff and lame from the incessant fighting.  His forearms were black and blue from wrist to elbow, what of the countless blows he had warded off, and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester.  His head and arms and shoulders ached, the small of his back ached,—he ached all over, and his brain was heavy and dazed.  He did not play at school.  Nor did he study.  Even to sit still all day at his desk, as he did, was a torment.  It seemed centuries since he had begun the round of daily fights, and time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite future of daily fights.  Why couldn’t Cheese-Face be licked? he often thought; that would put him, Martin, out of his misery.  It never entered his head to cease fighting, to allow Cheese-Face to whip him.

And so he dragged himself to the Enquirer alley, sick in body and soul, but learning the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy, Cheese-Face, who was just as sick as he, and just a bit willing to quit if it were not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride painful and necessary.  One afternoon, after twenty minutes of desperate efforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that did not permit kicking, striking below the belt, nor hitting when one was down, Cheese-Face, panting for breath and reeling, offered to call it quits.  And Martin, head on arms, thrilled at the picture he caught of himself, at that moment in the afternoon of long ago, when he reeled and panted and choked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his throat from his cut lips; when he tottered toward Cheese-Face, spitting out a mouthful of blood so that he could speak, crying out that he would never quit, though Cheese-Face could give in if he wanted to.  And Cheese-Face did not give in, and the fight went on.

The next day and the next, days without end, witnessed the afternoon fight.  When he put up his arms, each day, to begin, they pained exquisitely, and the first few blows, struck and received, racked his soul; after that things grew numb, and he fought on blindly, seeing as in a dream, dancing and wavering, the large features and burning, animal-like eyes of Cheese-Face.  He concentrated upon that face; all else about him was a whirling void.  There was nothing else in the world but that face, and he would never know rest, blessed rest, until he had beaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles, or until the bleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him into a pulp.  And then, one way or the other, he would have rest.  But to quit,—for him, Martin, to quit,—that was impossible!

Came the day when he dragged himself into the Enquirer alley, and there was no Cheese-Face.  Nor did Cheese-Face come.  The boys congratulated him, and told him that he had licked Cheese-Face.  But Martin was not satisfied.  He had not licked Cheese-Face, nor had Cheese-Face licked him.  The problem had not been solved.  It was not until afterward that they learned that Cheese-Face’s father had died suddenly that very day.

Martin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven at the Auditorium.  He was seventeen and just back from sea.  A row started.  Somebody was bullying somebody, and Martin interfered, to be confronted by Cheese-Face’s blazing eyes.

“I’ll fix you after de show,” his ancient enemy hissed.

Martin nodded.  The nigger-heaven bouncer was making his way toward the disturbance.

“I’ll meet you outside, after the last act,” Martin whispered, the while his face showed undivided interest in the buck-and-wing dancing on the stage.

The bouncer glared and went away.

“Got a gang?” he asked Cheese-Face, at the end of the act.

“Sure.”

“Then I got to get one,” Martin announced.

Between the acts he mustered his following—three fellows he knew from the nail works, a railroad fireman, and half a dozen of the Boo Gang, along with as many more from the dread Eighteen-and-Market Gang.

When the theatre let out, the two gangs strung along inconspicuously on opposite sides of the street.  When they came to a quiet corner, they united and held a council of war.

“Eighth Street Bridge is the place,” said a red-headed fellow belonging to Cheese-Face’s Gang.  “You kin fight in the middle, under the electric light, an’ whichever way the bulls come in we kin sneak the other way.”

“That’s agreeable to me,” Martin said, after consulting with the leaders of his own gang.

The Eighth Street Bridge, crossing an arm of San Antonio Estuary, was the length of three city blocks.  In the middle of the bridge, and at each end, were electric lights.  No policeman could pass those end-lights unseen.  It was the safe place for the battle that revived itself under Martin’s eyelids.  He saw the two gangs, aggressive and sullen, rigidly keeping apart from each other and backing their respective champions; and he saw himself and Cheese-Face stripping.  A short distance away lookouts were set, their task being to watch the lighted ends of the bridge.  A member of the Boo Gang held Martin’s coat, and shirt, and cap, ready to race with them into safety in case the police interfered.  Martin watched himself go into the centre, facing Cheese-Face, and he heard himself say, as he held up his hand warningly:-

“They ain’t no hand-shakin’ in this.  Understand?  They ain’t nothin’ but scrap.  No throwin’ up the sponge.  This is a grudge-fight an’ it’s to a finish.  Understand?  Somebody’s goin’ to get licked.”

Cheese-Face wanted to demur,—Martin could see that,—but Cheese-Face’s old perilous pride was touched before the two gangs.

“Aw, come on,” he replied.  “Wot’s the good of chewin’ de rag about it?  I’m wit’ cheh to de finish.”

Then they fell upon each other, like young bulls, in all the glory of youth, with naked fists, with hatred, with desire to hurt, to maim, to destroy.  All the painful, thousand years’ gains of man in his upward climb through creation were lost.  Only the electric light remained, a milestone on the path of the great human adventure.  Martin and Cheese-Face were two savages, of the stone age, of the squatting place and the tree refuge.  They sank lower and lower into the muddy abyss, back into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life, striving blindly and chemically, as atoms strive, as the star-dust if the heavens strives, colliding, recoiling, and colliding again and eternally again.

“God!  We are animals!  Brute-beasts!”  Martin muttered aloud, as he watched the progress of the fight.  It was to him, with his splendid power of vision, like gazing into a kinetoscope.  He was both onlooker and participant.  His long months of culture and refinement shuddered at the sight; then the present was blotted out of his consciousness and the ghosts of the past possessed him, and he was Martin Eden, just returned from sea and fighting Cheese-Face on the Eighth Street Bridge.  He suffered and toiled and sweated and bled, and exulted when his naked knuckles smashed home.

They were twin whirlwinds of hatred, revolving about each other monstrously.  The time passed, and the two hostile gangs became very quiet.  They had never witnessed such intensity of ferocity, and they were awed by it.  The two fighters were greater brutes than they.  The first splendid velvet edge of youth and condition wore off, and they fought more cautiously and deliberately.  There had been no advantage gained either way.  “It’s anybody’s fight,” Martin heard some one saying.  Then he followed up a feint, right and left, was fiercely countered, and felt his cheek laid open to the bone.  No bare knuckle had done that.  He heard mutters of amazement at the ghastly damage wrought, and was drenched with his own blood.  But he gave no sign.  He became immensely wary, for he was wise with knowledge of the low cunning and foul vileness of his kind.  He watched and waited, until he feigned a wild rush, which he stopped midway, for he had seen the glint of metal.

“Hold up yer hand!” he screamed.  “Them’s brass knuckles, an’ you hit me with ’em!”

Both gangs surged forward, growling and snarling.  In a second there would be a free-for-all fight, and he would be robbed of his vengeance.  He was beside himself.

“You guys keep out!” he screamed hoarsely.  “Understand?  Say, d’ye understand?”

They shrank away from him.  They were brutes, but he was the arch-brute, a thing of terror that towered over them and dominated them.

“This is my scrap, an’ they ain’t goin’ to be no buttin’ in.  Gimme them knuckles.”

Cheese-Face, sobered and a bit frightened, surrendered the foul weapon.

“You passed ’em to him, you red-head sneakin’ in behind the push there,” Martin went on, as he tossed the knuckles into the water.  “I seen you, an’ I was wonderin’ what you was up to.  If you try anything like that again, I’ll beat cheh to death.  Understand?”

They fought on, through exhaustion and beyond, to exhaustion immeasurable and inconceivable, until the crowd of brutes, its blood-lust sated, terrified by what it saw, begged them impartially to cease.  And Cheese-Face, ready to drop and die, or to stay on his legs and die, a grisly monster out of whose features all likeness to Cheese-Face had been beaten, wavered and hesitated; but Martin sprang in and smashed him again and again.

Next, after a seeming century or so, with Cheese-Face weakening fast, in a mix-up of blows there was a loud snap, and Martin’s right arm dropped to his side.  It was a broken bone.  Everybody heard it and knew; and Cheese-Face knew, rushing like a tiger in the other’s extremity and raining blow on blow.  Martin’s gang surged forward to interfere.  Dazed by the rapid succession of blows, Martin warned them back with vile and earnest curses sobbed out and groaned in ultimate desolation and despair.

He punched on, with his left hand only, and as he punched, doggedly, only half-conscious, as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear in the gangs, and one who said with shaking voice: “This ain’t a scrap, fellows.  It’s murder, an’ we ought to stop it.”

But no one stopped it, and he was glad, punching on wearily and endlessly with his one arm, battering away at a bloody something before him that was not a face but a horror, an oscillating, hideous, gibbering, nameless thing that persisted before his wavering vision and would not go away.  And he punched on and on, slower and slower, as the last shreds of vitality oozed from him, through centuries and aeons and enormous lapses of time, until, in a dim way, he became aware that the nameless thing was sinking, slowly sinking down to the rough board-planking of the bridge.  And the next moment he was standing over it, staggering and swaying on shaky legs, clutching at the air for support, and saying in a voice he did not recognize:-

“D’ye want any more?  Say, d’ye want any more?”

He was still saying it, over and over,—demanding, entreating, threatening, to know if it wanted any more,—when he felt the fellows of his gang laying hands on him, patting him on the back and trying to put his coat on him.  And then came a sudden rush of blackness and oblivion.

The tin alarm-clock on the table ticked on, but Martin Eden, his face buried on his arms, did not hear it.  He heard nothing.  He did not think.  So absolutely had he relived life that he had fainted just as he fainted years before on the Eighth Street Bridge.  For a full minute the blackness and the blankness endured.  Then, like one from the dead, he sprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat pouring down his face, shouting:-

“I licked you, Cheese-Face!  It took me eleven years, but I licked you!”

His knees were trembling under him, he felt faint, and he staggered back to the bed, sinking down and sitting on the edge of it.  He was still in the clutch of the past.  He looked about the room, perplexed, alarmed, wondering where he was, until he caught sight of the pile of manuscripts in the corner.  Then the wheels of memory slipped ahead through four years of time, and he was aware of the present, of the books he had opened and the universe he had won from their pages, of his dreams and ambitions, and of his love for a pale wraith of a girl, sensitive and sheltered and ethereal, who would die of horror did she witness but one moment of what he had just lived through—one moment of all the muck of life through which he had waded.

He arose to his feet and confronted himself in the looking-glass.

“And so you arise from the mud, Martin Eden,” he said solemnly.  “And you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness, and thrust your shoulders among the stars, doing what all life has done, letting the ‘ape and tiger die’ and wresting highest heritage from all powers that be.”

He looked more closely at himself and laughed.

“A bit of hysteria and melodrama, eh?” he queried.  “Well, never mind.  You licked Cheese-Face, and you’ll lick the editors if it takes twice eleven years to do it in.  You can’t stop here.  You’ve got to go on.  It’s to a finish, you know.”

CHAPTER XVI

The alarm-clock went off, jerking Martin out of sleep with a suddenness that would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution.  Though he slept soundly, he awoke instantly, like a cat, and he awoke eagerly, glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone.  He hated the oblivion of sleep.  There was too much to do, too much of life to live.  He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of, and before the clock had ceased its clattering he was head and ears in the washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water.

But he did not follow his regular programme.  There was no unfinished story waiting his hand, no new story demanding articulation.  He had studied late, and it was nearly time for breakfast.  He tried to read a chapter in Fiske, but his brain was restless and he closed the book.  To-day witnessed the beginning of the new battle, wherein for some time there would be no writing.  He was aware of a sadness akin to that with which one leaves home and family.  He looked at the manuscripts in the corner.  That was it.  He was going away from them, his pitiful, dishonored children that were welcome nowhere.  He went over and began to rummage among them, reading snatches here and there, his favorite portions.  “The Pot” he honored with reading aloud, as he did “Adventure.”  “Joy,” his latest-born, completed the day before and tossed into the corner for lack of stamps, won his keenest approbation.

“I can’t understand,” he murmured.  “Or maybe it’s the editors who can’t understand.  There’s nothing wrong with that.  They publish worse every month.  Everything they publish is worse—nearly everything, anyway.”

After breakfast he put the type-writer in its case and carried it down into Oakland.

“I owe a month on it,” he told the clerk in the store.  “But you tell the manager I’m going to work and that I’ll be in in a month or so and straighten up.”

He crossed on the ferry to San Francisco and made his way to an employment office.  “Any kind of work, no trade,” he told the agent; and was interrupted by a new-comer, dressed rather foppishly, as some workingmen dress who have instincts for finer things.  The agent shook his head despondently.

“Nothin’ doin’ eh?” said the other.  “Well, I got to get somebody to-day.”

He turned and stared at Martin, and Martin, staring back, noted the puffed and discolored face, handsome and weak, and knew that he had been making a night of it.

“Lookin’ for a job?” the other queried.  “What can you do?”

“Hard labor, sailorizing, run a type-writer, no shorthand, can sit on a horse, willing to do anything and tackle anything,” was the answer.

The other nodded.

“Sounds good to me.  My name’s Dawson, Joe Dawson, an’ I’m tryin’ to scare up a laundryman.”

“Too much for me.”  Martin caught an amusing glimpse of himself ironing fluffy white things that women wear.  But he had taken a liking to the other, and he added: “I might do the plain washing.  I learned that much at sea.”  Joe Dawson thought visibly for a moment.

“Look here, let’s get together an’ frame it up.  Willin’ to listen?”

Martin nodded.

“This is a small laundry, up country, belongs to Shelly Hot Springs,—hotel, you know.  Two men do the work, boss and assistant.  I’m the boss.  You don’t work for me, but you work under me.  Think you’d be willin’ to learn?”

Martin paused to think.  The prospect was alluring.  A few months of it, and he would have time to himself for study.  He could work hard and study hard.

“Good grub an’ a room to yourself,” Joe said.

That settled it.  A room to himself where he could burn the midnight oil unmolested.

“But work like hell,” the other added.

Martin caressed his swelling shoulder-muscles significantly.  “That came from hard work.”

“Then let’s get to it.”  Joe held his hand to his head for a moment.  “Gee, but it’s a stem-winder.  Can hardly see.  I went down the line last night—everything—everything.  Here’s the frame-up.  The wages for two is a hundred and board.  I’ve ben drawin’ down sixty, the second man forty.  But he knew the biz.  You’re green.  If I break you in, I’ll be doing plenty of your work at first.  Suppose you begin at thirty, an’ work up to the forty.  I’ll play fair.  Just as soon as you can do your share you get the forty.”

“I’ll go you,” Martin announced, stretching out his hand, which the other shook.  “Any advance?—for rail-road ticket and extras?”

“I blew it in,” was Joe’s sad answer, with another reach at his aching head.  “All I got is a return ticket.”

“And I’m broke—when I pay my board.”

“Jump it,” Joe advised.

“Can’t.  Owe it to my sister.”

Joe whistled a long, perplexed whistle, and racked his brains to little purpose.

“I’ve got the price of the drinks,” he said desperately.  “Come on, an’ mebbe we’ll cook up something.”

Martin declined.

“Water-wagon?”

This time Martin nodded, and Joe lamented, “Wish I was.”

“But I somehow just can’t,” he said in extenuation.  “After I’ve ben workin’ like hell all week I just got to booze up.  If I didn’t, I’d cut my throat or burn up the premises.  But I’m glad you’re on the wagon.  Stay with it.”

Martin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this man—the gulf the books had made; but he found no difficulty in crossing back over that gulf.  He had lived all his life in the working-class world, and the camaraderie of labor was second nature with him.  He solved the difficulty of transportation that was too much for the other’s aching head.  He would send his trunk up to Shelly Hot Springs on Joe’s ticket.  As for himself, there was his wheel.  It was seventy miles, and he could ride it on Sunday and be ready for work Monday morning.  In the meantime he would go home and pack up.  There was no one to say good-by to.  Ruth and her whole family were spending the long summer in the Sierras, at Lake Tahoe.

He arrived at Shelly Hot Springs, tired and dusty, on Sunday night.  Joe greeted him exuberantly.  With a wet towel bound about his aching brow, he had been at work all day.

“Part of last week’s washin’ mounted up, me bein’ away to get you,” he explained.  “Your box arrived all right.  It’s in your room.  But it’s a hell of a thing to call a trunk.  An’ what’s in it?  Gold bricks?”

Joe sat on the bed while Martin unpacked.  The box was a packing-case for breakfast food, and Mr. Higginbotham had charged him half a dollar for it.  Two rope handles, nailed on by Martin, had technically transformed it into a trunk eligible for the baggage-car.  Joe watched, with bulging eyes, a few shirts and several changes of underclothes come out of the box, followed by books, and more books.

“Books clean to the bottom?” he asked.

Martin nodded, and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table which served in the room in place of a wash-stand.

“Gee!” Joe exploded, then waited in silence for the deduction to arise in his brain.  At last it came.

“Say, you don’t care for the girls—much?” he queried.

“No,” was the answer.  “I used to chase a lot before I tackled the books.  But since then there’s no time.”

“And there won’t be any time here.  All you can do is work an’ sleep.”

Martin thought of his five hours’ sleep a night, and smiled.  The room was situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the engine that pumped water, made electricity, and ran the laundry machinery.  The engineer, who occupied the adjoining room, dropped in to meet the new hand and helped Martin rig up an electric bulb, on an extension wire, so that it travelled along a stretched cord from over the table to the bed.

The next morning, at quarter-past six, Martin was routed out for a quarter-to-seven breakfast.  There happened to be a bath-tub for the servants in the laundry building, and he electrified Joe by taking a cold bath.

“Gee, but you’re a hummer!” Joe announced, as they sat down to breakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen.

With them was the engineer, the gardener, and the assistant gardener, and two or three men from the stable.  They ate hurriedly and gloomily, with but little conversation, and as Martin ate and listened he realized how far he had travelled from their status.  Their small mental caliber was depressing to him, and he was anxious to get away from them.  So he bolted his breakfast, a sickly, sloppy affair, as rapidly as they, and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the kitchen door.

It was a perfectly appointed, small steam laundry, wherein the most modern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do.  Martin, after a few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled clothes, while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft-soap, compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe his mouth and nostrils and eyes in bath-towels till he resembled a mummy.  Finished the sorting, Martin lent a hand in wringing the clothes.  This was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that went at a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute, tearing the matter from the clothes by centrifugal force.  Then Martin began to alternate between the dryer and the wringer, between times “shaking out” socks and stockings.  By the afternoon, one feeding and one, stacking up, they were running socks and stockings through the mangle while the irons were heating.  Then it was hot irons and underclothes till six o’clock, at which time Joe shook his head dubiously.

“Way behind,” he said.  “Got to work after supper.”  And after supper they worked until ten o’clock, under the blazing electric lights, until the last piece of under-clothing was ironed and folded away in the distributing room.  It was a hot California night, and though the windows were thrown wide, the room, with its red-hot ironing-stove, was a furnace.  Martin and Joe, down to undershirts, bare armed, sweated and panted for air.

“Like trimming cargo in the tropics,” Martin said, when they went upstairs.

“You’ll do,” Joe answered.  “You take hold like a good fellow.  If you keep up the pace, you’ll be on thirty dollars only one month.  The second month you’ll be gettin’ your forty.  But don’t tell me you never ironed before.  I know better.”

“Never ironed a rag in my life, honestly, until to-day,” Martin protested.

He was surprised at his weariness when he act into his room, forgetful of the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for fourteen hours.  He set the alarm clock at six, and measured back five hours to one o’clock.  He could read until then.  Slipping off his shoes, to ease his swollen feet, he sat down at the table with his books.  He opened Fiske, where he had left off to read.  But he found trouble began to read it through a second time.  Then he awoke, in pain from his stiffened muscles and chilled by the mountain wind that had begun to blow in through the window.  He looked at the clock.  It marked two.  He had been asleep four hours.  He pulled off his clothes and crawled into bed, where he was asleep the moment after his head touched the pillow.

Tuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil.  The speed with which Joe worked won Martin’s admiration.  Joe was a dozen of demons for work.  He was keyed up to concert pitch, and there was never a moment in the long day when he was not fighting for moments.  He concentrated himself upon his work and upon how to save time, pointing out to Martin where he did in five motions what could be done in three, or in three motions what could be done in two.  “Elimination of waste motion,” Martin phrased it as he watched and patterned after.  He was a good workman himself, quick and deft, and it had always been a point of pride with him that no man should do any of his work for him or outwork him.  As a result, he concentrated with a similar singleness of purpose, greedily snapping up the hints and suggestions thrown out by his working mate.  He “rubbed out” collars and cuffs, rubbing the starch out from between the double thicknesses of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to the ironing, and doing it at a pace that elicited Joe’s praise.

There was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done.  Joe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from task to task.  They starched two hundred white shirts, with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband, yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand.  At the same moment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not enter the starch, and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch—starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water.  And that night they worked till half-past ten, dipping “fancy starch”—all the frilled and airy, delicate wear of ladies.

“Me for the tropics and no clothes,” Martin laughed.

“And me out of a job,” Joe answered seriously.  “I don’t know nothin’ but laundrying.”

“And you know it well.”

“I ought to.  Began in the Contra Costa in Oakland when I was eleven, shakin’ out for the mangle.  That was eighteen years ago, an’ I’ve never done a tap of anything else.  But this job is the fiercest I ever had.  Ought to be one more man on it at least.  We work to-morrow night.  Always run the mangle Wednesday nights—collars an’ cuffs.”

Martin set his alarm, drew up to the table, and opened Fiske.  He did not finish the first paragraph.  The lines blurred and ran together and his head nodded.  He walked up and down, batting his head savagely with his fists, but he could not conquer the numbness of sleep.  He propped the book before him, and propped his eyelids with his fingers, and fell asleep with his eyes wide open.  Then he surrendered, and, scarcely conscious of what he did, got off his clothes and into bed.  He slept seven hours of heavy, animal-like sleep, and awoke by the alarm, feeling that he had not had enough.

“Doin’ much readin’?” Joe asked.

Martin shook his head.

“Never mind.  We got to run the mangle to-night, but Thursday we’ll knock off at six.  That’ll give you a chance.”

Martin washed woollens that day, by hand, in a large barrel, with strong soft-soap, by means of a hub from a wagon wheel, mounted on a plunger-pole that was attached to a spring-pole overhead.

“My invention,” Joe said proudly.  “Beats a washboard an’ your knuckles, and, besides, it saves at least fifteen minutes in the week, an’ fifteen minutes ain’t to be sneezed at in this shebang.”

Running the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also Joe’s idea.  That night, while they toiled on under the electric lights, he explained it.

“Something no laundry ever does, except this one.  An’ I got to do it if I’m goin’ to get done Saturday afternoon at three o’clock.  But I know how, an’ that’s the difference.  Got to have right heat, right pressure, and run ’em through three times.  Look at that!”  He held a cuff aloft.  “Couldn’t do it better by hand or on a tiler.”

Thursday, Joe was in a rage.  A bundle of extra “fancy starch” had come in.

“I’m goin’ to quit,” he announced.  “I won’t stand for it.  I’m goin’ to quit it cold.  What’s the good of me workin’ like a slave all week, a-savin’ minutes, an’ them a-comin’ an’ ringin’ in fancy-starch extras on me?  This is a free country, an’ I’m to tell that fat Dutchman what I think of him.  An’ I won’t tell ’m in French.  Plain United States is good enough for me.  Him a-ringin’ in fancy starch extras!”

“We got to work to-night,” he said the next moment, reversing his judgment and surrendering to fate.

And Martin did no reading that night.  He had seen no daily paper all week, and, strangely to him, felt no desire to see one.  He was not interested in the news.  He was too tired and jaded to be interested in anything, though he planned to leave Saturday afternoon, if they finished at three, and ride on his wheel to Oakland.  It was seventy miles, and the same distance back on Sunday afternoon would leave him anything but rested for the second week’s work.  It would have been easier to go on the train, but the round trip was two dollars and a half, and he was intent on saving money.

CHAPTER XVII

Martin learned to do many things.  In the course of the first week, in one afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts.  Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure.  By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom.  As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught them up and “backed” them.  This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.

It was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed.  Out on the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white, sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down.  But in the laundry the air was sizzling.  The huge stove roared red hot and white hot, while the irons, moving over the damp cloth, sent up clouds of steam.  The heat of these irons was different from that used by housewives.  An iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe and Martin, and such test was useless.  They went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental process that Martin admired but could not understand.  When the fresh irons proved too hot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water.  This again required a precise and subtle judgment.  A fraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost, and Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed—an automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine-like and unerring.

But there was little time in which to marvel.  All Martin’s consciousness was concentrated in the work.  Ceaselessly active, head and hand, an intelligent machine, all that constituted him a man was devoted to furnishing that intelligence.  There was no room in his brain for the universe and its mighty problems.  All the broad and spacious corridors of his mind were closed and hermetically sealed.  The echoing chamber of his soul was a narrow room, a conning tower, whence were directed his arm and shoulder muscles, his ten nimble fingers, and the swift-moving iron along its steaming path in broad, sweeping strokes, just so many strokes and no more, just so far with each stroke and not a fraction of an inch farther, rushing along interminable sleeves, sides, backs, and tails, and tossing the finished shirts, without rumpling, upon the receiving frame.  And even as his hurrying soul tossed, it was reaching for another shirt.  This went on, hour after hour, while outside all the world swooned under the overhead California sun.  But there was no swooning in that superheated room.  The cool guests on the verandas needed clean linen.

The sweat poured from Martin.  He drank enormous quantities of water, but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores.  Always, at sea, except at rare intervals, the work he performed had given him ample opportunity to commune with himself.  The master of the ship had been lord of Martin’s time; but here the manager of the hotel was lord of Martin’s thoughts as well.  He had no thoughts save for the nerve-racking, body-destroying toil.  Outside of that it was impossible to think.  He did not know that he loved Ruth.  She did not even exist, for his driven soul had no time to remember her.  It was only when he crawled to bed at night, or to breakfast in the morning, that she asserted herself to him in fleeting memories.

“This is hell, ain’t it?” Joe remarked once.

Martin nodded, but felt a rasp of irritation.  The statement had been obvious and unnecessary.  They did not talk while they worked.  Conversation threw them out of their stride, as it did this time, compelling Martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make two extra motions before he caught his stride again.

On Friday morning the washer ran.  Twice a week they had to put through hotel linen,—the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths, and napkins.  This finished, they buckled down to “fancy starch.”  It was slow work, fastidious and delicate, and Martin did not learn it so readily.  Besides, he could not take chances.  Mistakes were disastrous.

“See that,” Joe said, holding up a filmy corset-cover that he could have crumpled from view in one hand.  “Scorch that an’ it’s twenty dollars out of your wages.”

So Martin did not scorch that, and eased down on his muscular tension, though nervous tension rose higher than ever, and he listened sympathetically to the other’s blasphemies as he toiled and suffered over the beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do their own laundrying.  “Fancy starch” was Martin’s nightmare, and it was Joe’s, too.  It was “fancy starch” that robbed them of their hard-won minutes.  They toiled at it all day.  At seven in the evening they broke off to run the hotel linen through the mangle.  At ten o’clock, while the hotel guests slept, the two laundrymen sweated on at “fancy starch” till midnight, till one, till two.  At half-past two they knocked off.

Saturday morning it was “fancy starch,” and odds and ends, and at three in the afternoon the week’s work was done.

“You ain’t a-goin’ to ride them seventy miles into Oakland on top of this?” Joe demanded, as they sat on the stairs and took a triumphant smoke.

“Got to,” was the answer.

“What are you goin’ for?—a girl?”

“No; to save two and a half on the railroad ticket.  I want to renew some books at the library.”

“Why don’t you send ’em down an’ up by express?  That’ll cost only a quarter each way.”

Martin considered it.

“An’ take a rest to-morrow,” the other urged.  “You need it.  I know I do.  I’m plumb tuckered out.”

He looked it.  Indomitable, never resting, fighting for seconds and minutes all week, circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles, a fount of resistless energy, a high-driven human motor, a demon for work, now that he had accomplished the week’s task he was in a state of collapse.  He was worn and haggard, and his handsome face drooped in lean exhaustion.  He pulled his cigarette spiritlessly, and his voice was peculiarly dead and monotonous.  All the snap and fire had gone out of him.  His triumph seemed a sorry one.

“An’ next week we got to do it all over again,” he said sadly.  “An’ what’s the good of it all, hey?  Sometimes I wish I was a hobo.  They don’t work, an’ they get their livin’.  Gee!  I wish I had a glass of beer; but I can’t get up the gumption to go down to the village an’ get it.  You’ll stay over, an’ send your books dawn by express, or else you’re a damn fool.”

“But what can I do here all day Sunday?” Martin asked.

“Rest.  You don’t know how tired you are.  Why, I’m that tired Sunday I can’t even read the papers.  I was sick once—typhoid.  In the hospital two months an’ a half.  Didn’t do a tap of work all that time.  It was beautiful.”

“It was beautiful,” he repeated dreamily, a minute later.

Martin took a bath, after which he found that the head laundryman had disappeared.  Most likely he had gone for a glass of beer Martin decided, but the half-mile walk down to the village to find out seemed a long journey to him.  He lay on his bed with his shoes off, trying to make up his mind.  He did not reach out for a book.  He was too tired to feel sleepy, and he lay, scarcely thinking, in a semi-stupor of weariness, until it was time for supper.  Joe did not appear for that function, and when Martin heard the gardener remark that most likely he was ripping the slats off the bar, Martin understood.  He went to bed immediately afterward, and in the morning decided that he was greatly rested.  Joe being still absent, Martin procured a Sunday paper and lay down in a shady nook under the trees.  The morning passed, he knew not how.  He did not sleep, nobody disturbed him, and he did not finish the paper.  He came back to it in the afternoon, after dinner, and fell asleep over it.

So passed Sunday, and Monday morning he was hard at work, sorting clothes, while Joe, a towel bound tightly around his head, with groans and blasphemies, was running the washer and mixing soft-soap.

“I simply can’t help it,” he explained.  “I got to drink when Saturday night comes around.”

Another week passed, a great battle that continued under the electric lights each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three o’clock, when Joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then drifted down to the village to forget.  Martin’s Sunday was the same as before.  He slept in the shade of the trees, toiled aimlessly through the newspaper, and spent long hours lying on his back, doing nothing, thinking nothing.  He was too dazed to think, though he was aware that he did not like himself.  He was self-repelled, as though he had undergone some degradation or was intrinsically foul.  All that was god-like in him was blotted out.  The spur of ambition was blunted; he had no vitality with which to feel the prod of it.  He was dead.  His soul seemed dead.  He was a beast, a work-beast.  He saw no beauty in the sunshine sifting down through the green leaves, nor did the azure vault of the sky whisper as of old and hint of cosmic vastness and secrets trembling to disclosure.  Life was intolerably dull and stupid, and its taste was bad in his mouth.  A black screen was drawn across his mirror of inner vision, and fancy lay in a darkened sick-room where entered no ray of light.  He envied Joe, down in the village, rampant, tearing the slats off the bar, his brain gnawing with maggots, exulting in maudlin ways over maudlin things, fantastically and gloriously drunk and forgetful of Monday morning and the week of deadening toil to come.

A third week went by, and Martin loathed himself, and loathed life.  He was oppressed by a sense of failure.  There was reason for the editors refusing his stuff.  He could see that clearly now, and laugh at himself and the dreams he had dreamed.  Ruth returned his “Sea Lyrics” by mail.  He read her letter apathetically.  She did her best to say how much she liked them and that they were beautiful.  But she could not lie, and she could not disguise the truth from herself.  She knew they were failures, and he read her disapproval in every perfunctory and unenthusiastic line of her letter.  And she was right.  He was firmly convinced of it as he read the poems over.  Beauty and wonder had departed from him, and as he read the poems he caught himself puzzling as to what he had had in mind when he wrote them.  His audacities of phrase struck him as grotesque, his felicities of expression were monstrosities, and everything was absurd, unreal, and impossible.  He would have burned the “Sea Lyrics” on the spot, had his will been strong enough to set them aflame.  There was the engine-room, but the exertion of carrying them to the furnace was not worth while.  All his exertion was used in washing other persons’ clothes.  He did not have any left for private affairs.

He resolved that when Sunday came he would pull himself together and answer Ruth’s letter.  But Saturday afternoon, after work was finished and he had taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered him.  “I guess I’ll go down and see how Joe’s getting on,” was the way he put it to himself; and in the same moment he knew that he lied.  But he did not have the energy to consider the lie.  If he had had the energy, he would have refused to consider the lie, because he wanted to forget.  He started for the village slowly and casually, increasing his pace in spite of himself as he neared the saloon.

“I thought you was on the water-wagon,” was Joe’s greeting.

Martin did not deign to offer excuses, but called for whiskey, filling his own glass brimming before he passed the bottle.

“Don’t take all night about it,” he said roughly.

The other was dawdling with the bottle, and Martin refused to wait for him, tossing the glass off in a gulp and refilling it.

“Now, I can wait for you,” he said grimly; “but hurry up.”

Joe hurried, and they drank together.

“The work did it, eh?” Joe queried.

Martin refused to discuss the matter.

“It’s fair hell, I know,” the other went on, “but I kind of hate to see you come off the wagon, Mart.  Well, here’s how!”

Martin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and awing the barkeeper, an effeminate country youngster with watery blue eyes and hair parted in the middle.

“It’s something scandalous the way they work us poor devils,” Joe was remarking.  “If I didn’t bowl up, I’d break loose an’ burn down the shebang.  My bowlin’ up is all that saves ’em, I can tell you that.”

But Martin made no answer.  A few more drinks, and in his brain he felt the maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl.  Ah, it was living, the first breath of life he had breathed in three weeks.  His dreams came back to him.  Fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on, a thing of flaming brightness.  His mirror of vision was silver-clear, a flashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery.  Wonder and beauty walked with him, hand in hand, and all power was his.  He tried to tell it to Joe, but Joe had visions of his own, infallible schemes whereby he would escape the slavery of laundry-work and become himself the owner of a great steam laundry.

“I tell yeh, Mart, they won’t be no kids workin’ in my laundry—not on yer life.  An’ they won’t be no workin’ a livin’ soul after six P.M.  You hear me talk!  They’ll be machinery enough an’ hands enough to do it all in decent workin’ hours, an’ Mart, s’help me, I’ll make yeh superintendent of the shebang—the whole of it, all of it.  Now here’s the scheme.  I get on the water-wagon an’ save my money for two years—save an’ then—”

But Martin turned away, leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper, until that worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who, coming in, accepted Martin’s invitation.  Martin dispensed royal largess, inviting everybody up, farm-hands, a stableman, and the gardener’s assistant from the hotel, the barkeeper, and the furtive hobo who slid in like a shadow and like a shadow hovered at the end of the bar.

CHAPTER XVIII

Monday morning, Joe groaned over the first truck load of clothes to the washer.

“I say,” he began.

“Don’t talk to me,” Martin snarled.

“I’m sorry, Joe,” he said at noon, when they knocked off for dinner.

Tears came into the other’s eyes.

“That’s all right, old man,” he said.  “We’re in hell, an’ we can’t help ourselves.  An’, you know, I kind of like you a whole lot.  That’s what made it—hurt.  I cottoned to you from the first.”

Martin shook his hand.

“Let’s quit,” Joe suggested.  “Let’s chuck it, an’ go hoboin’.  I ain’t never tried it, but it must be dead easy.  An’ nothin’ to do.  Just think of it, nothin’ to do.  I was sick once, typhoid, in the hospital, an’ it was beautiful.  I wish I’d get sick again.”

The week dragged on.  The hotel was full, and extra “fancy starch” poured in upon them.  They performed prodigies of valor.  They fought late each night under the electric lights, bolted their meals, and even got in a half hour’s work before breakfast.  Martin no longer took his cold baths.  Every moment was drive, drive, drive, and Joe was the masterful shepherd of moments, herding them carefully, never losing one, counting them over like a miser counting gold, working on in a frenzy, toil-mad, a feverish machine, aided ably by that other machine that thought of itself as once having been one Martin Eden, a man.

But it was only at rare moments that Martin was able to think.  The house of thought was closed, its windows boarded up, and he was its shadowy caretaker.  He was a shadow.  Joe was right.  They were both shadows, and this was the unending limbo of toil.  Or was it a dream?  Sometimes, in the steaming, sizzling heat, as he swung the heavy irons back and forth over the white garments, it came to him that it was a dream.  In a short while, or maybe after a thousand years or so, he would awake, in his little room with the ink-stained table, and take up his writing where he had left off the day before.  Or maybe that was a dream, too, and the awakening would be the changing of the watches, when he would drop down out of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck, under the tropic stars, and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing through his flesh.

Came Saturday and its hollow victory at three o’clock.

“Guess I’ll go down an’ get a glass of beer,” Joe said, in the queer, monotonous tones that marked his week-end collapse.

Martin seemed suddenly to wake up.  He opened the kit bag and oiled his wheel, putting graphite on the chain and adjusting the bearings.  Joe was halfway down to the saloon when Martin passed by, bending low over the handle-bars, his legs driving the ninety-six gear with rhythmic strength, his face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust.  He slept in Oakland that night, and on Sunday covered the seventy miles back.  And on Monday morning, weary, he began the new week’s work, but he had kept sober.

A fifth week passed, and a sixth, during which he lived and toiled as a machine, with just a spark of something more in him, just a glimmering bit of soul, that compelled him, at each week-end, to scorch off the hundred and forty miles.  But this was not rest.  It was super-machinelike, and it helped to crush out the glimmering bit of soul that was all that was left him from former life.  At the end of the seventh week, without intending it, too weak to resist, he drifted down to the village with Joe and drowned life and found life until Monday morning.

Again, at the week-ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty miles, obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of still greater exertion.  At the end of three months he went down a third time to the village with Joe.  He forgot, and lived again, and, living, he saw, in clear illumination, the beast he was making of himself—not by the drink, but by the work.  The drink was an effect, not a cause.  It followed inevitably upon the work, as the night follows upon the day.  Not by becoming a toil-beast could he win to the heights, was the message the whiskey whispered to him, and he nodded approbation.  The whiskey was wise.  It told secrets on itself.

He called for paper and pencil, and for drinks all around, and while they drank his very good health, he clung to the bar and scribbled.

“A telegram, Joe,” he said.  “Read it.”

Joe read it with a drunken, quizzical leer.  But what he read seemed to sober him.  He looked at the other reproachfully, tears oozing into his eyes and down his cheeks.

“You ain’t goin’ back on me, Mart?” he queried hopelessly.

Martin nodded, and called one of the loungers to him to take the message to the telegraph office.

“Hold on,” Joe muttered thickly.  “Lemme think.”

He held on to the bar, his legs wobbling under him, Martin’s arm around him and supporting him, while he thought.

“Make that two laundrymen,” he said abruptly.  “Here, lemme fix it.”

“What are you quitting for?” Martin demanded.

“Same reason as you.”

“But I’m going to sea.  You can’t do that.”

“Nope,” was the answer, “but I can hobo all right, all right.”

Martin looked at him searchingly for a moment, then cried:-

“By God, I think you’re right!  Better a hobo than a beast of toil.  Why, man, you’ll live.  And that’s more than you ever did before.”

“I was in hospital, once,” Joe corrected.  “It was beautiful.  Typhoid—did I tell you?”

While Martin changed the telegram to “two laundrymen,” Joe went on:-

“I never wanted to drink when I was in hospital.  Funny, ain’t it?  But when I’ve ben workin’ like a slave all week, I just got to bowl up.  Ever noticed that cooks drink like hell?—an’ bakers, too?  It’s the work.  They’ve sure got to.  Here, lemme pay half of that telegram.”

“I’ll shake you for it,” Martin offered.

“Come on, everybody drink,” Joe called, as they rattled the dice and rolled them out on the damp bar.

Monday morning Joe was wild with anticipation.  He did not mind his aching head, nor did he take interest in his work.  Whole herds of moments stole away and were lost while their careless shepherd gazed out of the window at the sunshine and the trees.

“Just look at it!” he cried.  “An’ it’s all mine!  It’s free.  I can lie down under them trees an’ sleep for a thousan’ years if I want to.  Aw, come on, Mart, let’s chuck it.  What’s the good of waitin’ another moment.  That’s the land of nothin’ to do out there, an’ I got a ticket for it—an’ it ain’t no return ticket, b’gosh!”

A few minutes later, filling the truck with soiled clothes for the washer, Joe spied the hotel manager’s shirt.  He knew its mark, and with a sudden glorious consciousness of freedom he threw it on the floor and stamped on it.

“I wish you was in it, you pig-headed Dutchman!” he shouted.  “In it, an’ right there where I’ve got you!  Take that! an’ that! an’ that! damn you!  Hold me back, somebody!  Hold me back!”

Martin laughed and held him to his work.  On Tuesday night the new laundrymen arrived, and the rest of the week was spent breaking them into the routine.  Joe sat around and explained his system, but he did no more work.

“Not a tap,” he announced.  “Not a tap.  They can fire me if they want to, but if they do, I’ll quit.  No more work in mine, thank you kindly.  Me for the freight cars an’ the shade under the trees.  Go to it, you slaves!  That’s right.  Slave an’ sweat!  Slave an’ sweat!  An’ when you’re dead, you’ll rot the same as me, an’ what’s it matter how you live?—eh?  Tell me that—what’s it matter in the long run?”

On Saturday they drew their pay and came to the parting of the ways.

“They ain’t no use in me askin’ you to change your mind an’ hit the road with me?” Joe asked hopelessly:

Martin shook his head.  He was standing by his wheel, ready to start.  They shook hands, and Joe held on to his for a moment, as he said:-

“I’m goin’ to see you again, Mart, before you an’ me die.  That’s straight dope.  I feel it in my bones.  Good-by, Mart, an’ be good.  I like you like hell, you know.”

He stood, a forlorn figure, in the middle of the road, watching until Martin turned a bend and was gone from sight.

“He’s a good Indian, that boy,” he muttered.  “A good Indian.”

Then he plodded down the road himself, to the water tank, where half a dozen empties lay on a side-track waiting for the up freight.

CHAPTER XIX

Ruth and her family were home again, and Martin, returned to Oakland, saw much of her.  Having gained her degree, she was doing no more studying; and he, having worked all vitality out of his mind and body, was doing no writing.  This gave them time for each other that they had never had before, and their intimacy ripened fast.

At first, Martin had done nothing but rest.  He had slept a great deal, and spent long hours musing and thinking and doing nothing.  He was like one recovering from some terrible bout if hardship.  The first signs of reawakening came when he discovered more than languid interest in the daily paper.  Then he began to read again—light novels, and poetry; and after several days more he was head over heels in his long-neglected Fiske.  His splendid body and health made new vitality, and he possessed all the resiliency and rebound of youth.

Ruth showed her disappointment plainly when he announced that he was going to sea for another voyage as soon as he was well rested.

“Why do you want to do that?” she asked.

“Money,” was the answer.  “I’ll have to lay in a supply for my next attack on the editors.  Money is the sinews of war, in my case—money and patience.”

“But if all you wanted was money, why didn’t you stay in the laundry?”

“Because the laundry was making a beast of me.  Too much work of that sort drives to drink.”

She stared at him with horror in her eyes.

“Do you mean—?” she quavered.

It would have been easy for him to get out of it; but his natural impulse was for frankness, and he remembered his old resolve to be frank, no matter what happened.

“Yes,” he answered.  “Just that.  Several times.”

She shivered and drew away from him.

“No man that I have ever known did that—ever did that.”

“Then they never worked in the laundry at Shelly Hot Springs,” he laughed bitterly.  “Toil is a good thing.  It is necessary for human health, so all the preachers say, and Heaven knows I’ve never been afraid of it.  But there is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and the laundry up there is one of them.  And that’s why I’m going to sea one more voyage.  It will be my last, I think, for when I come back, I shall break into the magazines.  I am certain of it.”

She was silent, unsympathetic, and he watched her moodily, realizing how impossible it was for her to understand what he had been through.

“Some day I shall write it up—‘The Degradation of Toil’ or the ‘Psychology of Drink in the Working-class,’ or something like that for a title.”

Never, since the first meeting, had they seemed so far apart as that day.  His confession, told in frankness, with the spirit of revolt behind, had repelled her.  But she was more shocked by the repulsion itself than by the cause of it.  It pointed out to her how near she had drawn to him, and once accepted, it paved the way for greater intimacy.  Pity, too, was aroused, and innocent, idealistic thoughts of reform.  She would save this raw young man who had come so far.  She would save him from the curse of his early environment, and she would save him from himself in spite of himself.  And all this affected her as a very noble state of consciousness; nor did she dream that behind it and underlying it were the jealousy and desire of love.

They rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather, and out in the hills they read poetry aloud, now one and now the other, noble, uplifting poetry that turned one’s thoughts to higher things.  Renunciation, sacrifice, patience, industry, and high endeavor were the principles she thus indirectly preached—such abstractions being objectified in her mind by her father, and Mr. Butler, and by Andrew Carnegie, who, from a poor immigrant boy had arisen to be the book-giver of the world.  All of which was appreciated and enjoyed by Martin.  He followed her mental processes more clearly now, and her soul was no longer the sealed wonder it had been.  He was on terms of intellectual equality with her.  But the points of disagreement did not affect his love.  His love was more ardent than ever, for he loved her for what she was, and even her physical frailty was an added charm in his eyes.  He read of sickly Elizabeth Barrett, who for years had not placed her feet upon the ground, until that day of flame when she eloped with Browning and stood upright, upon the earth, under the open sky; and what Browning had done for her, Martin decided he could do for Ruth.  But first, she must love him.  The rest would be easy.  He would give her strength and health.  And he caught glimpses of their life, in the years to come, wherein, against a background of work and comfort and general well-being, he saw himself and Ruth reading and discussing poetry, she propped amid a multitude of cushions on the ground while she read aloud to him.  This was the key to the life they would live.  And always he saw that particular picture.  Sometimes it was she who leaned against him while he read, one arm about her, her head upon his shoulder.  Sometimes they pored together over the printed pages of beauty.  Then, too, she loved nature, and with generous imagination he changed the scene of their reading—sometimes they read in closed-in valleys with precipitous walls, or in high mountain meadows, and, again, down by the gray sand-dunes with a wreath of billows at their feet, or afar on some volcanic tropic isle where waterfalls descended and became mist, reaching the sea in vapor veils that swayed and shivered to every vagrant wisp of wind.  But always, in the foreground, lords of beauty and eternally reading and sharing, lay he and Ruth, and always in the background that was beyond the background of nature, dim and hazy, were work and success and money earned that made them free of the world and all its treasures.

“I should recommend my little girl to be careful,” her mother warned her one day.

“I know what you mean.  But it is impossible.  He if; not—”

Ruth was blushing, but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon for the first time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother held equally sacred.

“Your kind.”  Her mother finished the sentence for her.

Ruth nodded.

“I did not want to say it, but he is not.  He is rough, brutal, strong—too strong.  He has not—”

She hesitated and could not go on.  It was a new experience, talking over such matters with her mother.  And again her mother completed her thought for her.

“He has not lived a clean life, is what you wanted to say.”

Again Ruth nodded, and again a blush mantled her face.

“It is just that,” she said.  “It has not been his fault, but he has played much with—”

“With pitch?”

“Yes, with pitch.  And he frightens me.  Sometimes I am positively in terror of him, when he talks in that free and easy way of the things he has done—as if they did not matter.  They do matter, don’t they?”

They sat with their arms twined around each other, and in the pause her mother patted her hand and waited for her to go on.

“But I am interested in him dreadfully,” she continued.  “In a way he is my protégé.  Then, too, he is my first boy friend—but not exactly friend; rather protégé and friend combined.  Sometimes, too, when he frightens me, it seems that he is a bulldog I have taken for a plaything, like some of the ‘frat’ girls, and he is tugging hard, and showing his teeth, and threatening to break loose.”

Again her mother waited.

“He interests me, I suppose, like the bulldog.  And there is much good in him, too; but there is much in him that I would not like in—in the other way.  You see, I have been thinking.  He swears, he smokes, he drinks, he has fought with his fists (he has told me so, and he likes it; he says so).  He is all that a man should not be—a man I would want for my—” her voice sank very low—“husband.  Then he is too strong.  My prince must be tall, and slender, and dark—a graceful, bewitching prince.  No, there is no danger of my failing in love with Martin Eden.  It would be the worst fate that could befall me.”

“But it is not that that I spoke about,” her mother equivocated.  “Have you thought about him?  He is so ineligible in every way, you know, and suppose he should come to love you?”

“But he does—already,” she cried.

“It was to be expected,” Mrs. Morse said gently.  “How could it be otherwise with any one who knew you?”

“Olney hates me!” she exclaimed passionately.  “And I hate Olney.  I feel always like a cat when he is around.  I feel that I must be nasty to him, and even when I don’t happen to feel that way, why, he’s nasty to me, anyway.  But I am happy with Martin Eden.  No one ever loved me before—no man, I mean, in that way.  And it is sweet to be loved—that way.  You know what I mean, mother dear.  It is sweet to feel that you are really and truly a woman.”  She buried her face in her mother’s lap, sobbing.  “You think I am dreadful, I know, but I am honest, and I tell you just how I feel.”

Mrs. Morse was strangely sad and happy.  Her child-daughter, who was a bachelor of arts, was gone; but in her place was a woman-daughter.  The experiment had succeeded.  The strange void in Ruth’s nature had been filled, and filled without danger or penalty.  This rough sailor-fellow had been the instrument, and, though Ruth did not love him, he had made her conscious of her womanhood.

“His hand trembles,” Ruth was confessing, her face, for shame’s sake, still buried.  “It is most amusing and ridiculous, but I feel sorry for him, too.  And when his hands are too trembly, and his eyes too shiny, why, I lecture him about his life and the wrong way he is going about it to mend it.  But he worships me, I know.  His eyes and his hands do not lie.  And it makes me feel grown-up, the thought of it, the very thought of it; and I feel that I am possessed of something that is by rights my own—that makes me like the other girls—and—and young women.  And, then, too, I knew that I was not like them before, and I knew that it worried you.  You thought you did not let me know that dear worry of yours, but I did, and I wanted to—‘to make good,’ as Martin Eden says.”

It was a holy hour for mother and daughter, and their eyes were wet as they talked on in the twilight, Ruth all white innocence and frankness, her mother sympathetic, receptive, yet calmly explaining and guiding.

“He is four years younger than you,” she said.  “He has no place in the world.  He has neither position nor salary.  He is impractical.  Loving you, he should, in the name of common sense, be doing something that would give him the right to marry, instead of paltering around with those stories of his and with childish dreams.  Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never grow up.  He does not take to responsibility and a man’s work in the world like your father did, or like all our friends, Mr. Butler for one.  Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never be a money-earner.  And this world is so ordered that money is necessary to happiness—oh, no, not these swollen fortunes, but enough of money to permit of common comfort and decency.  He—he has never spoken?”

“He has not breathed a word.  He has not attempted to; but if he did, I would not let him, because, you see, I do not love him.”

“I am glad of that.  I should not care to see my daughter, my one daughter, who is so clean and pure, love a man like him.  There are noble men in the world who are clean and true and manly.  Wait for them.  You will find one some day, and you will love him and be loved by him, and you will be happy with him as your father and I have been happy with each other.  And there is one thing you must always carry in mind—”

“Yes, mother.”

Mrs. Morse’s voice was low and sweet as she said, “And that is the children.”

“I—have thought about them,” Ruth confessed, remembering the wanton thoughts that had vexed her in the past, her face again red with maiden shame that she should be telling such things.

“And it is that, the children, that makes Mr. Eden impossible,” Mrs. Morse went on incisively.  “Their heritage must be clean, and he is, I am afraid, not clean.  Your father has told me of sailors’ lives, and—and you understand.”

Ruth pressed her mother’s hand in assent, feeling that she really did understand, though her conception was of something vague, remote, and terrible that was beyond the scope of imagination.

“You know I do nothing without telling you,” she began.  “—Only, sometimes you must ask me, like this time.  I wanted to tell you, but I did not know how.  It is false modesty, I know it is that, but you can make it easy for me.  Sometimes, like this time, you must ask me, you must give me a chance.”

“Why, mother, you are a woman, too!” she cried exultantly, as they stood up, catching her mother’s hands and standing erect, facing her in the twilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them.  “I should never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this talk.  I had to learn that I was a woman to know that you were one, too.”

“We are women together,” her mother said, drawing her to her and kissing her.  “We are women together,” she repeated, as they went out of the room, their arms around each other’s waists, their hearts swelling with a new sense of companionship.

“Our little girl has become a woman,” Mrs. Morse said proudly to her husband an hour later.

“That means,” he said, after a long look at his wife, “that means she is in love.”

“No, but that she is loved,” was the smiling rejoinder.  “The experiment has succeeded.  She is awakened at last.”

“Then we’ll have to get rid of him.”  Mr. Morse spoke briskly, in matter-of-fact, businesslike tones.

But his wife shook her head.  “It will not be necessary.  Ruth says he is going to sea in a few days.  When he comes back, she will not be here.  We will send her to Aunt Clara’s.  And, besides, a year in the East, with the change in climate, people, ideas, and everything, is just the thing she needs.”

CHAPTER XX

The desire to write was stirring in Martin once more.  Stories and poems were springing into spontaneous creation in his brain, and he made notes of them against the future time when he would give them expression.  But he did not write.  This was his little vacation; he had resolved to devote it to rest and love, and in both matters he prospered.  He was soon spilling over with vitality, and each day he saw Ruth, at the moment of meeting, she experienced the old shock of his strength and health.

“Be careful,” her mother warned her once again.  “I am afraid you are seeing too much of Martin Eden.”

But Ruth laughed from security.  She was sure of herself, and in a few days he would be off to sea.  Then, by the time he returned, she would be away on her visit East.  There was a magic, however, in the strength and health of Martin.  He, too, had been told of her contemplated Eastern trip, and he felt the need for haste.  Yet he did not know how to make love to a girl like Ruth.  Then, too, he was handicapped by the possession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had been absolutely different from her.  They had known about love and life and flirtation, while she knew nothing about such things.  Her prodigious innocence appalled him, freezing on his lips all ardors of speech, and convincing him, in spite of himself, of his own unworthiness.  Also he was handicapped in another way.  He had himself never been in love before.  He had liked women in that turgid past of his, and been fascinated by some of them, but he had not known what it was to love them.  He had whistled in a masterful, careless way, and they had come to him.  They had been diversions, incidents, part of the game men play, but a small part at most.  And now, and for the first time, he was a suppliant, tender and timid and doubting.  He did not know the way of love, nor its speech, while he was frightened at his loved one’s clear innocence.

In the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on through the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game, he should let the other fellow play first.  This had stood him in good stead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well.  He knew how to watch the thing that was strange, and to wait for a weakness, for a place of entrance, to divulge itself.  It was like sparring for an opening in fist-fighting.  And when such an opening came, he knew by long experience to play for it and to play hard.

So he waited with Ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but not daring.  He was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure of himself.  Had he but known it, he was following the right course with her.  Love came into the world before articulate speech, and in its own early youth it had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten.  It was in this old, primitive way that Martin wooed Ruth.  He did not know he was doing it at first, though later he divined it.  The touch of his hand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter, the impact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers.  Whatever his tongue could express would have appealed, in part, to her judgment; but the touch of hand, the fleeting contact, made its way directly to her instinct.  Her judgment was as young as she, but her instincts were as old as the race and older.  They had been young when love was young, and they were wiser than convention and opinion and all the new-born things.  So her judgment did not act.  There was no call upon it, and she did not realize the strength of the appeal Martin made from moment to moment to her love-nature.  That he loved her, on the other hand, was as clear as day, and she consciously delighted in beholding his love-manifestations—the glowing eyes with their tender lights, the trembling hands, and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded darkly under his sunburn.  She even went farther, in a timid way inciting him, but doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and doing it half-consciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself.  She thrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman, and she took an Eve-like delight in tormenting him and playing upon him.

Tongue-tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly and awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact.  The touch of his hand was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than pleasant.  Martin did not know it, but he did know that it was not distasteful to her.  Not that they touched hands often, save at meeting and parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the pages of books side by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand.  And there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over the beauty of the books.  She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while he desired greatly, when they tired of reading, to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs.  On Sunday picnics at Shellmound Park and Schuetzen Park, in the past, he had rested his head on many laps, and, usually, he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their love.  To rest his head in a girl’s lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now, and now he found Ruth’s lap inaccessible and impossible.  Yet it was right here, in his reticence, that the strength of his wooing lay.  It was because of this reticence that he never alarmed her.  Herself fastidious and timid, she never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse.  Subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him, while he, sensing the growing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.

Once he dared, one afternoon, when he found her in the darkened living room with a blinding headache.

“Nothing can do it any good,” she had answered his inquiries.  “And besides, I don’t take headache powders.  Doctor Hall won’t permit me.”

“I can cure it, I think, and without drugs,” was Martin’s answer.  “I am not sure, of course, but I’d like to try.  It’s simply massage.  I learned the trick first from the Japanese.  They are a race of masseurs, you know.  Then I learned it all over again with variations from the Hawaiians.  They call it lomi-lomi.  It can accomplish most of the things drugs accomplish and a few things that drugs can’t.”

Scarcely had his hands touched her head when she sighed deeply.

“That is so good,” she said.

She spoke once again, half an hour later, when she asked, “Aren’t you tired?”

The question was perfunctory, and she knew what the answer would be.  Then she lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing balm of his strength: Life poured from the ends of his fingers, driving the pain before it, or so it seemed to her, until with the easement of pain, she fell asleep and he stole away.

She called him up by telephone that evening to thank him.

“I slept until dinner,” she said.  “You cured me completely, Mr. Eden, and I don’t know how to thank you.”

He was warm, and bungling of speech, and very happy, as he replied to her, and there was dancing in his mind, throughout the telephone conversation, the memory of Browning and of sickly Elizabeth Barrett.  What had been done could be done again, and he, Martin Eden, could do it and would do it for Ruth Morse.  He went back to his room and to the volume of Spencer’s “Sociology” lying open on the bed.  But he could not read.  Love tormented him and overrode his will, so that, despite all determination, he found himself at the little ink-stained table.  The sonnet he composed that night was the first of a love-cycle of fifty sonnets which was completed within two months.  He had the “Love-sonnets from the Portuguese” in mind as he wrote, and he wrote under the best conditions for great work, at a climacteric of living, in the throes of his own sweet love-madness.

The many hours he was not with Ruth he devoted to the “Love-cycle,” to reading at home, or to the public reading-rooms, where he got more closely in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their policy and content.  The hours he spent with Ruth were maddening alike in promise and in inconclusiveness.  It was a week after he cured her headache that a moonlight sail on Lake Merritt was proposed by Norman and seconded by Arthur and Olney.  Martin was the only one capable of handling a boat, and he was pressed into service.  Ruth sat near him in the stern, while the three young fellows lounged amidships, deep in a wordy wrangle over “frat” affairs.

The moon had not yet risen, and Ruth, gazing into the starry vault of the sky and exchanging no speech with Martin, experienced a sudden feeling of loneliness.  She glanced at him.  A puff of wind was heeling the boat over till the deck was awash, and he, one hand on tiller and the other on main-sheet, was luffing slightly, at the same time peering ahead to make out the near-lying north shore.  He was unaware of her gaze, and she watched him intently, speculating fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him, a young man with signal powers, to fritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure.

Her eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight, and over the firm-poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon his neck came back to her.  The strength she abhorred attracted her.  Her feeling of loneliness became more pronounced, and she felt tired.  Her position on the heeling boat irked her, and she remembered the headache he had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him.  He was sitting beside her, quite beside her, and the boat seemed to tilt her toward him.  Then arose in her the impulse to lean against him, to rest herself against his strength—a vague, half-formed impulse, which, even as she considered it, mastered her and made her lean toward him.  Or was it the heeling of the boat?  She did not know.  She never knew.  She knew only that she was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing rest were very good.  Perhaps it had been the boat’s fault, but she made no effort to retrieve it.  She leaned lightly against his shoulder, but she leaned, and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to make it more comfortable for her.

It was a madness, but she refused to consider the madness.  She was no longer herself but a woman, with a woman’s clinging need; and though she leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied.  She was no longer tired.  Martin did not speak.  Had he, the spell would have been broken.  But his reticence of love prolonged it.  He was dazed and dizzy.  He could not understand what was happening.  It was too wonderful to be anything but a delirium.  He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her in his arms.  His intuition told him it was the wrong thing to do, and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands occupied and fended off temptation.  But he luffed the boat less delicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack to the north shore.  The shore would compel him to go about, and the contact would be broken.  He sailed with skill, stopping way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible, giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against him on his shoulder.

When the first light of the rising moon touched the sail, illuminating the boat with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him.  And, even as she moved, she felt him move away.  The impulse to avoid detection was mutual.  The episode was tacitly and secretly intimate.  She sat apart from him with burning cheeks, while the full force of it came home to her.  She had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers see, nor Olney see.  Why had she done it?  She had never done anything like it in her life, and yet she had been moonlight-sailing with young men before.  She had never desired to do anything like it.  She was overcome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning womanhood.  She stole a glance at Martin, who was busy putting the boat about on the other tack, and she could have hated him for having made her do an immodest and shameful thing.  And he, of all men!  Perhaps her mother was right, and she was seeing too much of him.  It would never happen again, she resolved, and she would see less of him in the future.  She entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were alone together, of lying to him, of mentioning casually the attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up.  Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing moon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.

In the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a strange, puzzling creature, wilful over judgment and scornful of self-analysis, refusing to peer into the future or to think about herself and whither she was drifting.  She was in a fever of tingling mystery, alternately frightened and charmed, and in constant bewilderment.  She had one idea firmly fixed, however, which insured her security.  She would not let Martin speak his love.  As long as she did this, all would be well.  In a few days he would be off to sea.  And even if he did speak, all would be well.  It could not be otherwise, for she did not love him.  Of course, it would be a painful half hour for him, and an embarrassing half hour for her, because it would be her first proposal.  She thrilled deliciously at the thought.  She was really a woman, with a man ripe to ask for her in marriage.  It was a lure to all that was fundamental in her sex.  The fabric of her life, of all that constituted her, quivered and grew tremulous.  The thought fluttered in her mind like a flame-attracted moth.  She went so far as to imagine Martin proposing, herself putting the words into his mouth; and she rehearsed her refusal, tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to true and noble manhood.  And especially he must stop smoking cigarettes.  She would make a point of that.  But no, she must not let him speak at all.  She could stop him, and she had told her mother that she would.  All flushed and burning, she regretfully dismissed the conjured situation.  Her first proposal would have to be deferred to a more propitious time and a more eligible suitor.

CHAPTER XXI

Came a beautiful fall day, warm and languid, palpitant with the hush of the changing season, a California Indian summer day, with hazy sun and wandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air.  Filmy purple mists, that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color, hid in the recesses of the hills.  San Francisco lay like a blur of smoke upon her heights.  The intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten metal, whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy tide.  Far Tamalpais, barely seen in the silver haze, bulked hugely by the Golden Gate, the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering sun.  Beyond, the Pacific, dim and vast, was raising on its sky-line tumbled cloud-masses that swept landward, giving warning of the first blustering breath of winter.

The erasure of summer was at hand.  Yet summer lingered, fading and fainting among her hills, deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning a shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures, dying with the calm content of having lived and lived well.  And among the hills, on their favorite knoll, Martin and Ruth sat side by side, their heads bent over the same pages, he reading aloud from the love-sonnets of the woman who had loved Browning as it is given to few men to be loved.

But the reading languished.  The spell of passing beauty all about them was too strong.  The golden year was dying as it had lived, a beautiful and unrepentant voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture and content freighted heavily the air.  It entered into them, dreamy and languorous, weakening the fibres of resolution, suffusing the face of morality, or of judgment, with haze and purple mist.  Martin felt tender and melting, and from time to time warm glows passed over him.  His head was very near to hers, and when wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so that it touched his face, the printed pages swam before his eyes.

“I don’t believe you know a word of what you are reading,” she said once when he had lost his place.

He looked at her with burning eyes, and was on the verge of becoming awkward, when a retort came to his lips.

“I don’t believe you know either.  What was the last sonnet about?”

“I don’t know,” she laughed frankly.  “I’ve already forgotten.  Don’t let us read any more.  The day is too beautiful.”

“It will be our last in the hills for some time,” he announced gravely.  “There’s a storm gathering out there on the sea-rim.”

The book slipped from his hands to the ground, and they sat idly and silently, gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did not see.  Ruth glanced sidewise at his neck.  She did not lean toward him.  She was drawn by some force outside of herself and stronger than gravitation, strong as destiny.  It was only an inch to lean, and it was accomplished without volition on her part.  Her shoulder touched his as lightly as a butterfly touches a flower, and just as lightly was the counter-pressure.  She felt his shoulder press hers, and a tremor run through him.  Then was the time for her to draw back.  But she had become an automaton.  Her actions had passed beyond the control of her will—she never thought of control or will in the delicious madness that was upon her.  His arm began to steal behind her and around her.  She waited its slow progress in a torment of delight.  She waited, she knew not for what, panting, with dry, burning lips, a leaping pulse, and a fever of expectancy in all her blood.  The girdling arm lifted higher and drew her toward him, drew her slowly and caressingly.  She could wait no longer.  With a tired sigh, and with an impulsive movement all her own, unpremeditated, spasmodic, she rested her head upon his breast.  His head bent over swiftly, and, as his lips approached, hers flew to meet them.

This must be love, she thought, in the one rational moment that was vouchsafed her.  If it was not love, it was too shameful.  It could be nothing else than love.  She loved the man whose arms were around her and whose lips were pressed to hers.  She pressed more, tightly to him, with a snuggling movement of her body.  And a moment later, tearing herself half out of his embrace, suddenly and exultantly she reached up and placed both hands upon Martin Eden’s sunburnt neck.  So exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan, relaxed her hands, and lay half-swooning in his arms.

Not a word had been spoken, and not a word was spoken for a long time.  Twice he bent and kissed her, and each time her lips met his shyly and her body made its happy, nestling movement.  She clung to him, unable to release herself, and he sat, half supporting her in his arms, as he gazed with unseeing eyes at the blur of the great city across the bay.  For once there were no visions in his brain.  Only colors and lights and glows pulsed there, warm as the day and warm as his love.  He bent over her.  She was speaking.

“When did you love me?” she whispered.

“From the first, the very first, the first moment I laid eye on you.  I was mad for love of you then, and in all the time that has passed since then I have only grown the madder.  I am maddest, now, dear.  I am almost a lunatic, my head is so turned with joy.”

“I am glad I am a woman, Martin—dear,” she said, after a long sigh.

He crushed her in his arms again and again, and then asked:-

“And you?  When did you first know?”

“Oh, I knew it all the time, almost, from the first.”

“And I have been as blind as a bat!” he cried, a ring of vexation in his voice.  “I never dreamed it until just how, when I—when I kissed you.”

“I didn’t mean that.”  She drew herself partly away and looked at him.  “I meant I knew you loved almost from the first.”

“And you?” he demanded.

“It came to me suddenly.”  She was speaking very slowly, her eyes warm and fluttery and melting, a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go away.  “I never knew until just now when—you put your arms around me.  And I never expected to marry you, Martin, not until just now.  How did you make me love you?”

“I don’t know,” he laughed, “unless just by loving you, for I loved you hard enough to melt the heart of a stone, much less the heart of the living, breathing woman you are.”

“This is so different from what I thought love would be,” she announced irrelevantly.

“What did you think it would be like?”

“I didn’t think it would be like this.”  She was looking into his eyes at the moment, but her own dropped as she continued, “You see, I didn’t know what this was like.”

He offered to draw her toward him again, but it was no more than a tentative muscular movement of the girdling arm, for he feared that he might be greedy.  Then he felt her body yielding, and once again she was close in his arms and lips were pressed on lips.

“What will my people say?” she queried, with sudden apprehension, in one of the pauses.

“I don’t know.  We can find out very easily any time we are so minded.”

“But if mamma objects?  I am sure I am afraid to tell her.”

“Let me tell her,” he volunteered valiantly.  “I think your mother does not like me, but I can win her around.  A fellow who can win you can win anything.  And if we don’t—”

“Yes?”

“Why, we’ll have each other.  But there’s no danger not winning your mother to our marriage.  She loves you too well.”

“I should not like to break her heart,” Ruth said pensively.

He felt like assuring her that mothers’ hearts were not so easily broken, but instead he said, “And love is the greatest thing in the world.”

“Do you know, Martin, you sometimes frighten me.  I am frightened now, when I think of you and of what you have been.  You must be very, very good to me.  Remember, after all, that I am only a child.  I never loved before.”

“Nor I.  We are both children together.  And we are fortunate above most, for we have found our first love in each other.”

“But that is impossible!” she cried, withdrawing herself from his arms with a swift, passionate movement.  “Impossible for you.  You have been a sailor, and sailors, I have heard, are—are—”

Her voice faltered and died away.

“Are addicted to having a wife in every port?” he suggested.  “Is that what you mean?”

“Yes,” she answered in a low voice.

“But that is not love.”  He spoke authoritatively.  “I have been in many ports, but I never knew a passing touch of love until I saw you that first night.  Do you know, when I said good night and went away, I was almost arrested.”

“Arrested?”

“Yes.  The policeman thought I was drunk; and I was, too—with love for you.”

“But you said we were children, and I said it was impossible, for you, and we have strayed away from the point.”

“I said that I never loved anybody but you,” he replied.  “You are my first, my very first.”

“And yet you have been a sailor,” she objected.

“But that doesn’t prevent me from loving you the first.”

“And there have been women—other women—oh!”

And to Martin Eden’s supreme surprise, she burst into a storm of tears that took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away.  And all the while there was running through his head Kipling’s line: “And the Colonel’s lady and Judy O’Grady are sisters under their skins.”  It was true, he decided; though the novels he had read had led him to believe otherwise.  His idea, for which the novels were responsible, had been that only formal proposals obtained in the upper classes.  It was all right enough, down whence he had come, for youths and maidens to win each other by contact; but for the exalted personages up above on the heights to make love in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable.  Yet the novels were wrong.  Here was a proof of it.  The same pressures and caresses, unaccompanied by speech, that were efficacious with the girls of the working-class, were equally efficacious with the girls above the working-class.  They were all of the same flesh, after all, sisters under their skins; and he might have known as much himself had he remembered his Spencer.  As he held Ruth in his arms and soothed her, he took great consolation in the thought that the Colonel’s lady and Judy O’Grady were pretty much alike under their skins.  It brought Ruth closer to him, made her possible.  Her dear flesh was as anybody’s flesh, as his flesh.  There was no bar to their marriage.  Class difference was the only difference, and class was extrinsic.  It could be shaken off.  A slave, he had read, had risen to the Roman purple.  That being so, then he could rise to Ruth.  Under her purity, and saintliness, and culture, and ethereal beauty of soul, she was, in things fundamentally human, just like Lizzie Connolly and all Lizzie Connollys.  All that was possible of them was possible of her.  She could love, and hate, maybe have hysterics; and she could certainly be jealous, as she was jealous now, uttering her last sobs in his arms.

“Besides, I am older than you,” she remarked suddenly, opening her eyes and looking up at him, “three years older.”

“Hush, you are only a child, and I am forty years older than you, in experience,” was his answer.

In truth, they were children together, so far as love was concerned, and they were as naive and immature in the expression of their love as a pair of children, and this despite the fact that she was crammed with a university education and that his head was full of scientific philosophy and the hard facts of life.

They sat on through the passing glory of the day, talking as lovers are prone to talk, marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that had flung them so strangely together, and dogmatically believing that they loved to a degree never attained by lovers before.  And they returned insistently, again and again, to a rehearsal of their first impressions of each other and to hopeless attempts to analyze just precisely what they felt for each other and how much there was of it.

The cloud-masses on the western horizon received the descending sun, and the circle of the sky turned to rose, while the zenith glowed with the same warm color.  The rosy light was all about them, flooding over them, as she sang, “Good-by, Sweet Day.”  She sang softly, leaning in the cradle of his arm, her hands in his, their hearts in each other’s hands.

CHAPTER XXII

Mrs. Morse did not require a mother’s intuition to read the advertisement in Ruth’s face when she returned home.  The flush that would not leave the cheeks told the simple story, and more eloquently did the eyes, large and bright, reflecting an unmistakable inward glory.

“What has happened?” Mrs. Morse asked, having bided her time till Ruth had gone to bed.

“You know?” Ruth queried, with trembling lips.

For reply, her mother’s arm went around her, and a hand was softly caressing her hair.

“He did not speak,” she blurted out.  “I did not intend that it should happen, and I would never have let him speak—only he didn’t speak.”

“But if he did not speak, then nothing could have happened, could it?”

“But it did, just the same.”

“In the name of goodness, child, what are you babbling about?” Mrs. Morse was bewildered.  “I don’t think I know what happened, after all.  What did happen?”

Ruth looked at her mother in surprise.

“I thought you knew.  Why, we’re engaged, Martin and I.”

Mrs. Morse laughed with incredulous vexation.

“No, he didn’t speak,” Ruth explained.  “He just loved me, that was all.  I was as surprised as you are.  He didn’t say a word.  He just put his arm around me.  And—and I was not myself.  And he kissed me, and I kissed him.  I couldn’t help it.  I just had to.  And then I knew I loved him.”

She paused, waiting with expectancy the benediction of her mother’s kiss, but Mrs. Morse was coldly silent.

“It is a dreadful accident, I know,” Ruth recommenced with a sinking voice.  “And I don’t know how you will ever forgive me.  But I couldn’t help it.  I did not dream that I loved him until that moment.  And you must tell father for me.”

“Would it not be better not to tell your father?  Let me see Martin Eden, and talk with him, and explain.  He will understand and release you.”

“No! no!” Ruth cried, starting up.  “I do not want to be released.  I love him, and love is very sweet.  I am going to marry him—of course, if you will let me.”

“We have other plans for you, Ruth, dear, your father and I—oh, no, no; no man picked out for you, or anything like that.  Our plans go no farther than your marrying some man in your own station in life, a good and honorable gentleman, whom you will select yourself, when you love him.”

“But I love Martin already,” was the plaintive protest.

“We would not influence your choice in any way; but you are our daughter, and we could not bear to see you make a marriage such as this.  He has nothing but roughness and coarseness to offer you in exchange for all that is refined and delicate in you.  He is no match for you in any way.  He could not support you.  We have no foolish ideas about wealth, but comfort is another matter, and our daughter should at least marry a man who can give her that—and not a penniless adventurer, a sailor, a cowboy, a smuggler, and Heaven knows what else, who, in addition to everything, is hare-brained and irresponsible.”

Ruth was silent.  Every word she recognized as true.

“He wastes his time over his writing, trying to accomplish what geniuses and rare men with college educations sometimes accomplish.  A man thinking of marriage should be preparing for marriage.  But not he.  As I have said, and I know you agree with me, he is irresponsible.  And why should he not be?  It is the way of sailors.  He has never learned to be economical or temperate.  The spendthrift years have marked him.  It is not his fault, of course, but that does not alter his nature.  And have you thought of the years of licentiousness he inevitably has lived?  Have you thought of that, daughter?  You know what marriage means.”

Ruth shuddered and clung close to her mother.

“I have thought.”  Ruth waited a long time for the thought to frame itself.  “And it is terrible.  It sickens me to think of it.  I told you it was a dreadful accident, my loving him; but I can’t help myself.  Could you help loving father?  Then it is the same with me.  There is something in me, in him—I never knew it was there until to-day—but it is there, and it makes me love him.  I never thought to love him, but, you see, I do,” she concluded, a certain faint triumph in her voice.

They talked long, and to little purpose, in conclusion agreeing to wait an indeterminate time without doing anything.

The same conclusion was reached, a little later that night, between Mrs. Morse and her husband, after she had made due confession of the miscarriage of her plans.

“It could hardly have come otherwise,” was Mr. Morse’s judgment.  “This sailor-fellow has been the only man she was in touch with.  Sooner or later she was going to awaken anyway; and she did awaken, and lo! here was this sailor-fellow, the only accessible man at the moment, and of course she promptly loved him, or thought she did, which amounts to the same thing.”

Mrs. Morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon Ruth, rather than to combat her.  There would be plenty of time for this, for Martin was not in position to marry.

“Let her see all she wants of him,” was Mr. Morse’s advice.  “The more she knows him, the less she’ll love him, I wager.  And give her plenty of contrast.  Make a point of having young people at the house.  Young women and young men, all sorts of young men, clever men, men who have done something or who are doing things, men of her own class, gentlemen.  She can gauge him by them.  They will show him up for what he is.  And after all, he is a mere boy of twenty-one.  Ruth is no more than a child.  It is calf love with the pair of them, and they will grow out of it.”

So the matter rested.  Within the family it was accepted that Ruth and Martin were engaged, but no announcement was made.  The family did not think it would ever be necessary.  Also, it was tacitly understood that it was to be a long engagement.  They did not ask Martin to go to work, nor to cease writing.  They did not intend to encourage him to mend himself.  And he aided and abetted them in their unfriendly designs, for going to work was farthest from his thoughts.

“I wonder if you’ll like what I have done!” he said to Ruth several days later.  “I’ve decided that boarding with my sister is too expensive, and I am going to board myself.  I’ve rented a little room out in North Oakland, retired neighborhood and all the rest, you know, and I’ve bought an oil-burner on which to cook.”

Ruth was overjoyed.  The oil-burner especially pleased her.

“That was the way Mr. Butler began his start,” she said.

Martin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman, and went on: “I put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to the editors again.  Then to-day I moved in, and to-morrow I start to work.”

“A position!” she cried, betraying the gladness of her surprise in all her body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand, smiling.  “And you never told me!  What is it?”

He shook his head.

“I meant that I was going to work at my writing.”  Her face fell, and he went on hastily.  “Don’t misjudge me.  I am not going in this time with any iridescent ideas.  It is to be a cold, prosaic, matter-of-fact business proposition.  It is better than going to sea again, and I shall earn more money than any position in Oakland can bring an unskilled man.”

“You see, this vacation I have taken has given me perspective.  I haven’t been working the life out of my body, and I haven’t been writing, at least not for publication.  All I’ve done has been to love you and to think.  I’ve read some, too, but it has been part of my thinking, and I have read principally magazines.  I have generalized about myself, and the world, my place in it, and my chance to win to a place that will be fit for you.  Also, I’ve been reading Spencer’s ‘Philosophy of Style,’ and found out a lot of what was the matter with me—or my writing, rather; and for that matter with most of the writing that is published every month in the magazines.”

“But the upshot of it all—of my thinking and reading and loving—is that I am going to move to Grub Street.  I shall leave masterpieces alone and do hack-work—jokes, paragraphs, feature articles, humorous verse, and society verse—all the rot for which there seems so much demand.  Then there are the newspaper syndicates, and the newspaper short-story syndicates, and the syndicates for the Sunday supplements.  I can go ahead and hammer out the stuff they want, and earn the equivalent of a good salary by it.  There are free-lances, you know, who earn as much as four or five hundred a month.  I don’t care to become as they; but I’ll earn a good living, and have plenty of time to myself, which I wouldn’t have in any position.”

“Then, I’ll have my spare time for study and for real work.  In between the grind I’ll try my hand at masterpieces, and I’ll study and prepare myself for the writing of masterpieces.  Why, I am amazed at the distance I have come already.  When I first tried to write, I had nothing to write about except a few paltry experiences which I neither understood nor appreciated.  But I had no thoughts.  I really didn’t.  I didn’t even have the words with which to think.  My experiences were so many meaningless pictures.  But as I began to add to my knowledge, and to my vocabulary, I saw something more in my experiences than mere pictures.  I retained the pictures and I found their interpretation.  That was when I began to do good work, when I wrote ‘Adventure,’  ‘Joy,’ ‘The Pot,’ ‘The Wine of Life,’ ‘The Jostling Street,’ the ‘Love-cycle,’ and the ‘Sea Lyrics.’  I shall write more like them, and better; but I shall do it in my spare time.  My feet are on the solid earth, now.  Hack-work and income first, masterpieces afterward.  Just to show you, I wrote half a dozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies; and just as I was going to bed, the thought struck me to try my hand at a triolet—a humorous one; and inside an hour I had written four.  They ought to be worth a dollar apiece.  Four dollars right there for a few afterthoughts on the way to bed.”

“Of course it’s all valueless, just so much dull and sordid plodding; but it is no more dull and sordid than keeping books at sixty dollars a month, adding up endless columns of meaningless figures until one dies.  And furthermore, the hack-work keeps me in touch with things literary and gives me time to try bigger things.”

“But what good are these bigger-things, these masterpieces?” Ruth demanded.  “You can’t sell them.”

“Oh, yes, I can,” he began; but she interrupted.

“All those you named, and which you say yourself are good—you have not sold any of them.  We can’t get married on masterpieces that won’t sell.”

“Then we’ll get married on triolets that will sell,” he asserted stoutly, putting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive sweetheart toward him.

“Listen to this,” he went on in attempted gayety.  “It’s not art, but it’s a dollar.

“He came in
When I was out,
To borrow some tin
Was why he came in,
And he went without;
So I was in
And he was out.”

The merry lilt with which he had invested the jingle was at variance with the dejection that came into his face as he finished.  He had drawn no smile from Ruth.  She was looking at him in an earnest and troubled way.

“It may be a dollar,” she said, “but it is a jester’s dollar, the fee of a clown.  Don’t you see, Martin, the whole thing is lowering.  I want the man I love and honor to be something finer and higher than a perpetrator of jokes and doggerel.”

“You want him to be like—say Mr. Butler?” he suggested.

“I know you don’t like Mr. Butler,” she began.

“Mr. Butler’s all right,” he interrupted.  “It’s only his indigestion I find fault with.  But to save me I can’t see any difference between writing jokes or comic verse and running a type-writer, taking dictation, or keeping sets of books.  It is all a means to an end.  Your theory is for me to begin with keeping books in order to become a successful lawyer or man of business.  Mine is to begin with hack-work and develop into an able author.”

“There is a difference,” she insisted.

“What is it?”

“Why, your good work, what you yourself call good, you can’t sell.  You have tried, you know that,—but the editors won’t buy it.”

“Give me time, dear,” he pleaded.  “The hack-work is only makeshift, and I don’t take it seriously.  Give me two years.  I shall succeed in that time, and the editors will be glad to buy my good work.  I know what I am saying; I have faith in myself.  I know what I have in me; I know what literature is, now; I know the average rot that is poured out by a lot of little men; and I know that at the end of two years I shall be on the highroad to success.  As for business, I shall never succeed at it.  I am not in sympathy with it.  It strikes me as dull, and stupid, and mercenary, and tricky.  Anyway I am not adapted for it.  I’d never get beyond a clerkship, and how could you and I be happy on the paltry earnings of a clerk?  I want the best of everything in the world for you, and the only time when I won’t want it will be when there is something better.  And I’m going to get it, going to get all of it.  The income of a successful author makes Mr. Butler look cheap.  A ‘best-seller’ will earn anywhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars—sometimes more and sometimes less; but, as a rule, pretty close to those figures.”

She remained silent; her disappointment was apparent.

“Well?” he asked.

“I had hoped and planned otherwise.  I had thought, and I still think, that the best thing for you would be to study shorthand—you already know type-writing—and go into father’s office.  You have a good mind, and I am confident you would succeed as a lawyer.”

CHAPTER XXIII

That Ruth had little faith in his power as a writer, did not alter her nor diminish her in Martin’s eyes.  In the breathing spell of the vacation he had taken, he had spent many hours in self-analysis, and thereby learned much of himself.  He had discovered that he loved beauty more than fame, and that what desire he had for fame was largely for Ruth’s sake.  It was for this reason that his desire for fame was strong.  He wanted to be great in the world’s eyes; “to make good,” as he expressed it, in order that the woman he loved should be proud of him and deem him worthy.

As for himself, he loved beauty passionately, and the joy of serving her was to him sufficient wage.  And more than beauty he loved Ruth.  He considered love the finest thing in the world.  It was love that had worked the revolution in him, changing him from an uncouth sailor to a student and an artist; therefore, to him, the finest and greatest of the three, greater than learning and artistry, was love.  Already he had discovered that his brain went beyond Ruth’s, just as it went beyond the brains of her brothers, or the brain of her father.  In spite of every advantage of university training, and in the face of her bachelorship of arts, his power of intellect overshadowed hers, and his year or so of self-study and equipment gave him a mastery of the affairs of the world and art and life that she could never hope to possess.

All this he realized, but it did not affect his love for her, nor her love for him.  Love was too fine and noble, and he was too loyal a lover for him to besmirch love with criticism.  What did love have to do with Ruth’s divergent views on art, right conduct, the French Revolution, or equal suffrage?  They were mental processes, but love was beyond reason; it was superrational.  He could not belittle love.  He worshipped it.  Love lay on the mountain-tops beyond the valley-land of reason.  It was a sublimates condition of existence, the topmost peak of living, and it came rarely.  Thanks to the school of scientific philosophers he favored, he knew the biological significance of love; but by a refined process of the same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that the human organism achieved its highest purpose in love, that love must not be questioned, but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life.  Thus, he considered the lover blessed over all creatures, and it was a delight to him to think of “God’s own mad lover,” rising above the things of earth, above wealth and judgment, public opinion and applause, rising above life itself and “dying on a kiss.”

Much of this Martin had already reasoned out, and some of it he reasoned out later.  In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation except when he went to see Ruth, and living like a Spartan.  He paid two dollars and a half a month rent for the small room he got from his Portuguese landlady, Maria Silva, a virago and a widow, hard working and harsher tempered, rearing her large brood of children somehow, and drowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of the thin, sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon for fifteen cents.  From detesting her and her foul tongue at first, Martin grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made.  There were but four rooms in the little house—three, when Martin’s was subtracted.  One of these, the parlor, gay with an ingrain carpet and dolorous with a funeral card and a death-picture of one of her numerous departed babes, was kept strictly for company.  The blinds were always down, and her barefooted tribe was never permitted to enter the sacred precinct save on state occasions.  She cooked, and all ate, in the kitchen, where she likewise washed, starched, and ironed clothes on all days of the week except Sunday; for her income came largely from taking in washing from her more prosperous neighbors.  Remained the bedroom, small as the one occupied by Martin, into which she and her seven little ones crowded and slept.  It was an everlasting miracle to Martin how it was accomplished, and from her side of the thin partition he heard nightly every detail of the going to bed, the squalls and squabbles, the soft chattering, and the sleepy, twittering noises as of birds.  Another source of income to Maria were her cows, two of them, which she milked night and morning and which gained a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew on either side the public side walks, attended always by one or more of her ragged boys, whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in keeping their eyes out for the poundmen.

In his own small room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept house.  Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch, was the kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand.  The bed, against the rear wall, occupied two-thirds of the total space of the room.  The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau, manufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which was shed day by day.  This bureau stood in the corner, and in the opposite corner, on the table’s other flank, was the kitchen—the oil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions, and a bucket of water on the floor.  Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there being no tap in his room.  On days when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous.  Over the bed, hoisted by a tackle to the ceiling, was his bicycle.  At first he had tried to keep it in the basement; but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires, had driven him out.  Next he attempted the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night-long.  Then he had retreated with it to his room and slung it aloft.

A small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated and for which there was no room on the table or under the table.  Hand in hand with reading, he had developed the habit of making notes, and so copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence for him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several clothes-lines across the room on which the notes were hung.  Even so, he was crowded until navigating the room was a difficult task.  He could not open the door without first closing the closet door, and vice versa.  It was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the room in a straight line.  To go from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag course that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without collisions.  Having settled the difficulty of the conflicting doors, he had to steer sharply to the right to avoid the kitchen.  Next, he sheered to the left, to escape the foot of the bed; but this sheer, if too generous, brought him against the corner of the table.  With a sudden twitch and lurch, he terminated the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal, one bank of which was the bed, the other the table.  When the one chair in the room was at its usual place before the table, the canal was unnavigable.  When the chair was not in use, it reposed on top of the bed, though sometimes he sat on the chair when cooking, reading a book while the water boiled, and even becoming skilful enough to manage a paragraph or two while steak was frying.  Also, so small was the little corner that constituted the kitchen, he was able, sitting down, to reach anything he needed.  In fact, it was expedient to cook sitting down; standing up, he was too often in his own way.

In conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything, he possessed knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time nutritious and cheap.  Pea-soup was a common article in his diet, as well as potatoes and beans, the latter large and brown and cooked in Mexican style.  Rice, cooked as American housewives never cook it and can never learn to cook it, appeared on Martin’s table at least once a day.  Dried fruits were less expensive than fresh, and he had usually a pot of them, cooked and ready at hand, for they took the place of butter on his bread.  Occasionally he graced his table with a piece of round-steak, or with a soup-bone.  Coffee, without cream or milk, he had twice a day, in the evening substituting tea; but both coffee and tea were excellently cooked.

There was need for him to be economical.  His vacation had consumed nearly all he had earned in the laundry, and he was so far from his market that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first returns from his hack-work.  Except at such times as he saw Ruth, or dropped in to see his sister Gertude, he lived a recluse, in each day accomplishing at least three days’ labor of ordinary men.  He slept a scant five hours, and only one with a constitution of iron could have held himself down, as Martin did, day after day, to nineteen consecutive hours of toil.  He never lost a moment.  On the looking-glass were lists of definitions and pronunciations; when shaving, or dressing, or combing his hair, he conned these lists over.  Similar lists were on the wall over the oil-stove, and they were similarly conned while he was engaged in cooking or in washing the dishes.  New lists continually displaced the old ones.  Every strange or partly familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down, and later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were typed and pinned to the wall or looking-glass.  He even carried them in his pockets, and reviewed them at odd moments on the street, or while waiting in butcher shop or grocery to be served.

He went farther in the matter.  Reading the works of men who had arrived, he noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the tricks by which they had been achieved—the tricks of narrative, of exposition, of style, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams; and of all these he made lists for study.  He did not ape.  He sought principles.  He drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms, till out of many such, culled from many writers, he was able to induce the general principle of mannerism, and, thus equipped, to cast about for new and original ones of his own, and to weigh and measure and appraise them properly.  In similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases, the phrases of living language, phrases that bit like acid and scorched like flame, or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of the arid desert of common speech.  He sought always for the principle that lay behind and beneath.  He wanted to know how the thing was done; after that he could do it for himself.  He was not content with the fair face of beauty.  He dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory, where cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe; and, having dissected and learned the anatomy of beauty, he was nearer being able to create beauty itself.

He was so made that he could work only with understanding.  He could not work blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing and trusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced should be right and fine.  He had no patience with chance effects.  He wanted to know why and how.  His was deliberate creative genius, and, before he began a story or poem, the thing itself was already alive in his brain, with the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in his conscious possession.  Otherwise the effort was doomed to failure.  On the other hand, he appreciated the chance effects in words and phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain, and that later stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable connotations.  Before such he bowed down and marvelled, knowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of any man.  And no matter how much he dissected beauty in search of the principles that underlie beauty and make beauty possible, he was aware, always, of the innermost mystery of beauty to which he did not penetrate and to which no man had ever penetrated.  He knew full well, from his Spencer, that man can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything, and that the mystery of beauty was no less than that of life—nay, more that the fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted, and that he himself was but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric, twisted of sunshine and star-dust and wonder.

In fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay entitled “Star-dust,” in which he had his fling, not at the principles of criticism, but at the principal critics.  It was brilliant, deep, philosophical, and deliciously touched with laughter.  Also it was promptly rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted.  But having cleared his mind of it, he went serenely on his way.  It was a habit he developed, of incubating and maturing his thought upon a subject, and of then rushing into the type-writer with it.  That it did not see print was a matter a small moment with him.  The writing of it was the culminating act of a long mental process, the drawing together of scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the data with which his mind was burdened.  To write such an article was the conscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh material and problems.  It was in a way akin to that common habit of men and women troubled by real or fancied grievances, who periodically and volubly break their long-suffering silence and “have their say” till the last word is said.

CHAPTER XXIV

The weeks passed.  Martin ran out of money, and publishers’ checks were far away as ever.  All his important manuscripts had come back and been started out again, and his hack-work fared no better.  His little kitchen was no longer graced with a variety of foods.  Caught in the pinch with a part sack of rice and a few pounds of dried apricots, rice and apricots was his menu three times a day for five days hand-running.  Then he startled to realize on his credit.  The Portuguese grocer, to whom he had hitherto paid cash, called a halt when Martin’s bill reached the magnificent total of three dollars and eighty-five cents.

“For you see,” said the grocer, “you no catcha da work, I losa da mon’.”

And Martin could reply nothing.  There was no way of explaining.  It was not true business principle to allow credit to a strong-bodied young fellow of the working-class who was too lazy to work.

“You catcha da job, I let you have mora da grub,” the grocer assured Martin.  “No job, no grub.  Thata da business.”  And then, to show that it was purely business foresight and not prejudice, “Hava da drink on da house—good friends justa da same.”

So Martin drank, in his easy way, to show that he was good friends with the house, and then went supperless to bed.

The fruit store, where Martin had bought his vegetables, was run by an American whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin run a bill of five dollars before stopping his credit.  The baker stopped at two dollars, and the butcher at four dollars.  Martin added his debts and found that he was possessed of a total credit in all the world of fourteen dollars and eighty-five cents.  He was up with his type-writer rent, but he estimated that he could get two months’ credit on that, which would be eight dollars.  When that occurred, he would have exhausted all possible credit.

The last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes, and for a week he had potatoes, and nothing but potatoes, three times a day.  An occasional dinner at Ruth’s helped to keep strength in his body, though he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping when his appetite was raging at sight of so much food spread before it.  Now and again, though afflicted with secret shame, he dropped in at his sister’s at meal-time and ate as much as he dared—more than he dared at the Morse table.

Day by day he worked on, and day by day the postman delivered to him rejected manuscripts.  He had no money for stamps, so the manuscripts accumulated in a heap under the table.  Came a day when for forty hours he had not tasted food.  He could not hope for a meal at Ruth’s, for she was away to San Rafael on a two weeks’ visit; and for very shame’s sake he could not go to his sister’s.  To cap misfortune, the postman, in his afternoon round, brought him five returned manuscripts.  Then it was that Martin wore his overcoat down into Oakland, and came back without it, but with five dollars tinkling in his pocket.  He paid a dollar each on account to the four tradesmen, and in his kitchen fried steak and onions, made coffee, and stewed a large pot of prunes.  And having dined, he sat down at his table-desk and completed before midnight an essay which he entitled “The Dignity of Usury.”  Having typed it out, he flung it under the table, for there had been nothing left from the five dollars with which to buy stamps.

Later on he pawned his watch, and still later his wheel, reducing the amount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and sending them out.  He was disappointed with his hack-work.  Nobody cared to buy.  He compared it with what he found in the newspapers, weeklies, and cheap magazines, and decided that his was better, far better, than the average; yet it would not sell.  Then he discovered that most of the newspapers printed a great deal of what was called “plate” stuff, and he got the address of the association that furnished it.  His own work that he sent in was returned, along with a stereotyped slip informing him that the staff supplied all the copy that was needed.

In one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of incident and anecdote.  Here was a chance.  His paragraphs were returned, and though he tried repeatedly he never succeeded in placing one.  Later on, when it no longer mattered, he learned that the associate editors and sub-editors augmented their salaries by supplying those paragraphs themselves.  The comic weeklies returned his jokes and humorous verse, and the light society verse he wrote for the large magazines found no abiding-place.  Then there was the newspaper storiette.  He knew that he could write better ones than were published.  Managing to obtain the addresses of two newspaper syndicates, he deluged them with storiettes.  When he had written twenty and failed to place one of them, he ceased.  And yet, from day to day, he read storiettes in the dailies and weeklies, scores and scores of storiettes, not one of which would compare with his.  In his despondency, he concluded that he had no judgment whatever, that he was hypnotized by what he wrote, and that he was a self-deluded pretender.

The inhuman editorial machine ran smoothly as ever.  He folded the stamps in with his manuscript, dropped it into the letter-box, and from three weeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps and handed him the manuscript.  Surely there were no live, warm editors at the other end.  It was all wheels and cogs and oil-cups—a clever mechanism operated by automatons.  He reached stages of despair wherein he doubted if editors existed at all.  He had never received a sign of the existence of one, and from absence of judgment in rejecting all he wrote it seemed plausible that editors were myths, manufactured and maintained by office boys, typesetters, and pressmen.

The hours he spent with Ruth were the only happy ones he had, and they were not all happy.  He was afflicted always with a gnawing restlessness, more tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed her love; for now that he did possess her love, the possession of her was far away as ever.  He had asked for two years; time was flying, and he was achieving nothing.  Again, he was always conscious of the fact that she did not approve what he was doing.  She did not say so directly.  Yet indirectly she let him understand it as clearly and definitely as she could have spoken it.  It was not resentment with her, but disapproval; though less sweet-natured women might have resented where she was no more than disappointed.  Her disappointment lay in that this man she had taken to mould, refused to be moulded.  To a certain extent she had found his clay plastic, then it had developed stubbornness, declining to be shaped in the image of her father or of Mr. Butler.

What was great and strong in him, she missed, or, worse yet, misunderstood.  This man, whose clay was so plastic that he could live in any number of pigeonholes of human existence, she thought wilful and most obstinate because she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole, which was the only one she knew.  She could not follow the flights of his mind, and when his brain got beyond her, she deemed him erratic.  Nobody else’s brain ever got beyond her.  She could always follow her father and mother, her brothers and Olney; wherefore, when she could not follow Martin, she believed the fault lay with him.  It was the old tragedy of insularity trying to serve as mentor to the universal.

“You worship at the shrine of the established,” he told her once, in a discussion they had over Praps and Vanderwater.  “I grant that as authorities to quote they are most excellent—the two foremost literary critics in the United States.  Every school teacher in the land looks up to Vanderwater as the Dean of American criticism.  Yet I read his stuff, and it seems to me the perfection of the felicitous expression of the inane.  Why, he is no more than a ponderous bromide, thanks to Gelett Burgess.  And Praps is no better.  His ‘Hemlock Mosses,’ for instance is beautifully written.  Not a comma is out of place; and the tone—ah!—is lofty, so lofty.  He is the best-paid critic in the United States.  Though, Heaven forbid! he’s not a critic at all.  They do criticism better in England.

“But the point is, they sound the popular note, and they sound it so beautifully and morally and contentedly.  Their reviews remind me of a British Sunday.  They are the popular mouthpieces.  They back up your professors of English, and your professors of English back them up.  And there isn’t an original idea in any of their skulls.  They know only the established,—in fact, they are the established.  They are weak minded, and the established impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of the brewery is impressed on a beer bottle.  And their function is to catch all the young fellows attending the university, to drive out of their minds any glimmering originality that may chance to be there, and to put upon them the stamp of the established.”

“I think I am nearer the truth,” she replied, “when I stand by the established, than you are, raging around like an iconoclastic South Sea Islander.”

“It was the missionary who did the image breaking,” he laughed.  “And unfortunately, all the missionaries are off among the heathen, so there are none left at home to break those old images, Mr. Vanderwater and Mr. Praps.”

“And the college professors, as well,” she added.

He shook his head emphatically.  “No; the science professors should live.  They’re really great.  But it would be a good deed to break the heads of nine-tenths of the English professors—little, microscopic-minded parrots!”

Which was rather severe on the professors, but which to Ruth was blasphemy.  She could not help but measure the professors, neat, scholarly, in fitting clothes, speaking in well-modulated voices, breathing of culture and refinement, with this almost indescribable young fellow whom somehow she loved, whose clothes never would fit him, whose heavy muscles told of damning toil, who grew excited when he talked, substituting abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance for cool self-possession.  They at least earned good salaries and were—yes, she compelled herself to face it—were gentlemen; while he could not earn a penny, and he was not as they.

She did not weigh Martin’s words nor judge his argument by them.  Her conclusion that his argument was wrong was reached—unconsciously, it is true—by a comparison of externals.  They, the professors, were right in their literary judgments because they were successes.  Martin’s literary judgments were wrong because he could not sell his wares.  To use his own phrase, they made good, and he did not make good.  And besides, it did not seem reasonable that he should be right—he who had stood, so short a time before, in that same living room, blushing and awkward, acknowledging his introduction, looking fearfully about him at the bric-a-brac his swinging shoulders threatened to break, asking how long since Swinburne died, and boastfully announcing that he had read “Excelsior” and the “Psalm of Life.”

Unwittingly, Ruth herself proved his point that she worshipped the established.  Martin followed the processes of her thoughts, but forbore to go farther.  He did not love her for what she thought of Praps and Vanderwater and English professors, and he was coming to realize, with increasing conviction, that he possessed brain-areas and stretches of knowledge which she could never comprehend nor know existed.

In music she thought him unreasonable, and in the matter of opera not only unreasonable but wilfully perverse.

“How did you like it?” she asked him one night, on the way home from the opera.

It was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a month’s rigid economizing on food.  After vainly waiting for him to speak about it, herself still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen and heard, she had asked the question.

“I liked the overture,” was his answer.  “It was splendid.”

“Yes, but the opera itself?”

“That was splendid too; that is, the orchestra was, though I’d have enjoyed it more if those jumping-jacks had kept quiet or gone off the stage.”

Ruth was aghast.

“You don’t mean Tetralani or Barillo?” she queried.

“All of them—the whole kit and crew.”

“But they are great artists,” she protested.

“They spoiled the music just the same, with their antics and unrealities.”

“But don’t you like Barillo’s voice?” Ruth asked.  “He is next to Caruso, they say.”

“Of course I liked him, and I liked Tetralani even better.  Her voice is exquisite—or at least I think so.”

“But, but—” Ruth stammered.  “I don’t know what you mean, then.  You admire their voices, yet say they spoiled the music.”

“Precisely that.  I’d give anything to hear them in concert, and I’d give even a bit more not to hear them when the orchestra is playing.  I’m afraid I am a hopeless realist.  Great singers are not great actors.  To hear Barillo sing a love passage with the voice of an angel, and to hear Tetralani reply like another angel, and to hear it all accompanied by a perfect orgy of glowing and colorful music—is ravishing, most ravishing.  I do not admit it.  I assert it.  But the whole effect is spoiled when I look at them—at Tetralani, five feet ten in her stocking feet and weighing a hundred and ninety pounds, and at Barillo, a scant five feet four, greasy-featured, with the chest of a squat, undersized blacksmith, and at the pair of them, attitudinizing, clasping their breasts, flinging their arms in the air like demented creatures in an asylum; and when I am expected to accept all this as the faithful illusion of a love-scene between a slender and beautiful princess and a handsome, romantic, young prince—why, I can’t accept it, that’s all.  It’s rot; it’s absurd; it’s unreal.  That’s what’s the matter with it.  It’s not real.  Don’t tell me that anybody in this world ever made love that way.  Why, if I’d made love to you in such fashion, you’d have boxed my ears.”

“But you misunderstand,” Ruth protested.  “Every form of art has its limitations.”  (She was busy recalling a lecture she had heard at the university on the conventions of the arts.)  “In painting there are only two dimensions to the canvas, yet you accept the illusion of three dimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the canvas.  In writing, again, the author must be omnipotent.  You accept as perfectly legitimate the author’s account of the secret thoughts of the heroine, and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when thinking these thoughts, and that neither the author nor any one else was capable of hearing them.  And so with the stage, with sculpture, with opera, with every art form.  Certain irreconcilable things must be accepted.”

“Yes, I understood that,” Martin answered.  “All the arts have their conventions.”  (Ruth was surprised at his use of the word.  It was as if he had studied at the university himself, instead of being ill-equipped from browsing at haphazard through the books in the library.)  “But even the conventions must be real.  Trees, painted on flat cardboard and stuck up on each side of the stage, we accept as a forest.  It is a real enough convention.  But, on the other hand, we would not accept a sea scene as a forest.  We can’t do it.  It violates our senses.  Nor would you, or, rather, should you, accept the ravings and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics to-night as a convincing portrayal of love.”

“But you don’t hold yourself superior to all the judges of music?” she protested.

“No, no, not for a moment.  I merely maintain my right as an individual.  I have just been telling you what I think, in order to explain why the elephantine gambols of Madame Tetralani spoil the orchestra for me.  The world’s judges of music may all be right.  But I am I, and I won’t subordinate my taste to the unanimous judgment of mankind.  If I don’t like a thing, I don’t like it, that’s all; and there is no reason under the sun why I should ape a liking for it just because the majority of my fellow-creatures like it, or make believe they like it.  I can’t follow the fashions in the things I like or dislike.”

“But music, you know, is a matter of training,” Ruth argued; “and opera is even more a matter of training.  May it not be—”

“That I am not trained in opera?” he dashed in.

She nodded.

“The very thing,” he agreed.  “And I consider I am fortunate in not having been caught when I was young.  If I had, I could have wept sentimental tears to-night, and the clownish antics of that precious pair would have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty of the accompanying orchestra.  You are right.  It’s mostly a matter of training.  And I am too old, now.  I must have the real or nothing.  An illusion that won’t convince is a palpable lie, and that’s what grand opera is to me when little Barillo throws a fit, clutches mighty Tetralani in his arms (also in a fit), and tells her how passionately he adores her.”

Again Ruth measured his thoughts by comparison of externals and in accordance with her belief in the established.  Who was he that he should be right and all the cultured world wrong?  His words and thoughts made no impression upon her.  She was too firmly intrenched in the established to have any sympathy with revolutionary ideas.  She had always been used to music, and she had enjoyed opera ever since she was a child, and all her world had enjoyed it, too.  Then by what right did Martin Eden emerge, as he had so recently emerged, from his rag-time and working-class songs, and pass judgment on the world’s music?  She was vexed with him, and as she walked beside him she had a vague feeling of outrage.  At the best, in her most charitable frame of mind, she considered the statement of his views to be a caprice, an erratic and uncalled-for prank.  But when he took her in his arms at the door and kissed her good night in tender lover-fashion, she forgot everything in the outrush of her own love to him.  And later, on a sleepless pillow, she puzzled, as she had often puzzled of late, as to how it was that she loved so strange a man, and loved him despite the disapproval of her people.

And next day Martin Eden cast hack-work aside, and at white heat hammered out an essay to which he gave the title, “The Philosophy of Illusion.”  A stamp started it on its travels, but it was destined to receive many stamps and to be started on many travels in the months that followed.

CHAPTER XXV

Maria Silva was poor, and all the ways of poverty were clear to her.  Poverty, to Ruth, was a word signifying a not-nice condition of existence.  That was her total knowledge on the subject.  She knew Martin was poor, and his condition she associated in her mind with the boyhood of Abraham Lincoln, of Mr. Butler, and of other men who had become successes.  Also, while aware that poverty was anything but delectable, she had a comfortable middle-class feeling that poverty was salutary, that it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not degraded and hopeless drudges.  So that her knowledge that Martin was so poor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her.  She even considered it the hopeful side of the situation, believing that sooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his writing.

Ruth never read hunger in Martin’s face, which had grown lean and had enlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks.  In fact, she marked the change in his face with satisfaction.  It seemed to refine him, to remove from him much of the dross of flesh and the too animal-like vigor that lured her while she detested it.  Sometimes, when with her, she noted an unusual brightness in his eyes, and she admired it, for it made him appear more the poet and the scholar—the things he would have liked to be and which she would have liked him to be.  But Maria Silva read a different tale in the hollow cheeks and the burning eyes, and she noted the changes in them from day to day, by them following the ebb and flow of his fortunes.  She saw him leave the house with his overcoat and return without it, though the day was chill and raw, and promptly she saw his cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger leave his eyes.  In the same way she had seen his wheel and watch go, and after each event she had seen his vigor bloom again.

Likewise she watched his toils, and knew the measure of the midnight oil he burned.  Work!  She knew that he outdid her, though his work was of a different order.  And she was surprised to behold that the less food he had, the harder he worked.  On occasion, in a casual sort of way, when she thought hunger pinched hardest, she would send him in a loaf of new baking, awkwardly covering the act with banter to the effect that it was better than he could bake.  And again, she would send one of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher of hot soup, debating inwardly the while whether she was justified in taking it from the mouths of her own flesh and blood.  Nor was Martin ungrateful, knowing as he did the lives of the poor, and that if ever in the world there was charity, this was it.

On a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house, Maria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine.  Martin, coming into her kitchen to fetch water, was invited to sit down and drink.  He drank her very-good health, and in return she drank his.  Then she drank to prosperity in his undertakings, and he drank to the hope that James Grant would show up and pay her for his washing.  James Grant was a journeymen carpenter who did not always pay his bills and who owed Maria three dollars.

Both Maria and Martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs, and it went swiftly to their heads.  Utterly differentiated creatures that they were, they were lonely in their misery, and though the misery was tacitly ignored, it was the bond that drew them together.  Maria was amazed to learn that he had been in the Azores, where she had lived until she was eleven.  She was doubly amazed that he had been in the Hawaiian Islands, whither she had migrated from the Azores with her people.  But her amazement passed all bounds when he told her he had been on Maui, the particular island whereon she had attained womanhood and married.  Kahului, where she had first met her husband,—he, Martin, had been there twice!  Yes, she remembered the sugar steamers, and he had been on them—well, well, it was a small world.  And Wailuku!  That place, too!  Did he know the head-luna of the plantation?  Yes, and had had a couple of drinks with him.

And so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw, sour wine.  To Martin the future did not seem so dim.  Success trembled just before him.  He was on the verge of clasping it.  Then he studied the deep-lined face of the toil-worn woman before him, remembered her soups and loaves of new baking, and felt spring up in him the warmest gratitude and philanthropy.

“Maria,” he exclaimed suddenly.  “What would you like to have?”

She looked at him, bepuzzled.

“What would you like to have now, right now, if you could get it?”

“Shoe alla da roun’ for da childs—seven pairs da shoe.”

“You shall have them,” he announced, while she nodded her head gravely.  “But I mean a big wish, something big that you want.”

Her eyes sparkled good-naturedly.  He was choosing to make fun with her, Maria, with whom few made fun these days.

“Think hard,” he cautioned, just as she was opening her mouth to speak.

“Alla right,” she answered.  “I thinka da hard.  I lika da house, dis house—all mine, no paya da rent, seven dollar da month.”

“You shall have it,” he granted, “and in a short time.  Now wish the great wish.  Make believe I am God, and I say to you anything you want you can have.  Then you wish that thing, and I listen.”

Maria considered solemnly for a space.

“You no ’fraid?” she asked warningly.

“No, no,” he laughed, “I’m not afraid.  Go ahead.”

“Most verra big,” she warned again.

“All right.  Fire away.”

“Well, den—”  She drew a big breath like a child, as she voiced to the uttermost all she cared to demand of life.  “I lika da have one milka ranch—good milka ranch.  Plenty cow, plenty land, plenty grass.  I lika da have near San Le-an; my sister liva dere.  I sella da milk in Oakland.  I maka da plentee mon.  Joe an’ Nick no runna da cow.  Dey go-a to school.  Bimeby maka da good engineer, worka da railroad.  Yes, I lika da milka ranch.”

She paused and regarded Martin with twinkling eyes.

“You shall have it,” he answered promptly.

She nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wine-glass and to the giver of the gift she knew would never be given.  His heart was right, and in her own heart she appreciated his intention as much as if the gift had gone with it.

“No, Maria,” he went on; “Nick and Joe won’t have to peddle milk, and all the kids can go to school and wear shoes the whole year round.  It will be a first-class milk ranch—everything complete.  There will be a house to live in and a stable for the horses, and cow-barns, of course.  There will be chickens, pigs, vegetables, fruit trees, and everything like that; and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two.  Then you won’t have anything to do but take care of the children.  For that matter, if you find a good man, you can marry and take it easy while he runs the ranch.”

And from such largess, dispensed from his future, Martin turned and took his one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop.  His plight was desperate for him to do this, for it cut him off from Ruth.  He had no second-best suit that was presentable, and though he could go to the butcher and the baker, and even on occasion to his sister’s, it was beyond all daring to dream of entering the Morse home so disreputably apparelled.

He toiled on, miserable and well-nigh hopeless.  It began to appear to him that the second battle was lost and that he would have to go to work.  In doing this he would satisfy everybody—the grocer, his sister, Ruth, and even Maria, to whom he owed a month’s room rent.  He was two months behind with his type-writer, and the agency was clamoring for payment or for the return of the machine.  In desperation, all but ready to surrender, to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh start, he took the civil service examinations for the Railway Mail.  To his surprise, he passed first.  The job was assured, though when the call would come to enter upon his duties nobody knew.

It was at this time, at the lowest ebb, that the smooth-running editorial machine broke down.  A cog must have slipped or an oil-cup run dry, for the postman brought him one morning a short, thin envelope.  Martin glanced at the upper left-hand corner and read the name and address of the Transcontinental Monthly.  His heart gave a great leap, and he suddenly felt faint, the sinking feeling accompanied by a strange trembling of the knees.  He staggered into his room and sat down on the bed, the envelope still unopened, and in that moment came understanding to him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt of extraordinarily good news.

Of course this was good news.  There was no manuscript in that thin envelope, therefore it was an acceptance.  He knew the story in the hands of the Transcontinental.  It was “The Ring of Bells,” one of his horror stories, and it was an even five thousand words.  And, since first-class magazines always paid on acceptance, there was a check inside.  Two cents a word—twenty dollars a thousand; the check must be a hundred dollars.  One hundred dollars!  As he tore the envelope open, every item of all his debts surged in his brain—$3.85 to the grocer; butcher $4.00 flat; baker, $2.00; fruit store, $5.00; total, $14.85.  Then there was room rent, $2.50; another month in advance, $2.50; two months’ type-writer, $8.00; a month in advance, $4.00; total, $31.85.  And finally to be added, his pledges, plus interest, with the pawnbroker—watch, $5.50; overcoat, $5.50; wheel, $7.75; suit of clothes, $5.50 (60 % interest, but what did it matter?)—grand total, $56.10.  He saw, as if visible in the air before him, in illuminated figures, the whole sum, and the subtraction that followed and that gave a remainder of $43.90.  When he had squared every debt, redeemed every pledge, he would still have jingling in his pockets a princely $43.90.  And on top of that he would have a month’s rent paid in advance on the type-writer and on the room.

By this time he had drawn the single sheet of type-written letter out and spread it open.  There was no check.  He peered into the envelope, held it to the light, but could not trust his eyes, and in trembling haste tore the envelope apart.  There was no check.  He read the letter, skimming it line by line, dashing through the editor’s praise of his story to the meat of the letter, the statement why the check had not been sent.  He found no such statement, but he did find that which made him suddenly wilt.  The letter slid from his hand.  His eyes went lack-lustre, and he lay back on the pillow, pulling the blanket about him and up to his chin.

Five dollars for “The Ring of Bells”—five dollars for five thousand words!  Instead of two cents a word, ten words for a cent!  And the editor had praised it, too.  And he would receive the check when the story was published.  Then it was all poppycock, two cents a word for minimum rate and payment upon acceptance.  It was a lie, and it had led him astray.  He would never have attempted to write had he known that.  He would have gone to work—to work for Ruth.  He went back to the day he first attempted to write, and was appalled at the enormous waste of time—and all for ten words for a cent.  And the other high rewards of writers, that he had read about, must be lies, too.  His second-hand ideas of authorship were wrong, for here was the proof of it.

The Transcontinental sold for twenty-five cents, and its dignified and artistic cover proclaimed it as among the first-class magazines.  It was a staid, respectable magazine, and it had been published continuously since long before he was born.  Why, on the outside cover were printed every month the words of one of the world’s great writers, words proclaiming the inspired mission of the Transcontinental by a star of literature whose first coruscations had appeared inside those self-same covers.  And the high and lofty, heaven-inspired Transcontinental paid five dollars for five thousand words!  The great writer had recently died in a foreign land—in dire poverty, Martin remembered, which was not to be wondered at, considering the magnificent pay authors receive.

Well, he had taken the bait, the newspaper lies about writers and their pay, and he had wasted two years over it.  But he would disgorge the bait now.  Not another line would he ever write.  He would do what Ruth wanted him to do, what everybody wanted him to do—get a job.  The thought of going to work reminded him of Joe—Joe, tramping through the land of nothing-to-do.  Martin heaved a great sigh of envy.  The reaction of nineteen hours a day for many days was strong upon him.  But then, Joe was not in love, had none of the responsibilities of love, and he could afford to loaf through the land of nothing-to-do.  He, Martin, had something to work for, and go to work he would.  He would start out early next morning to hunt a job.  And he would let Ruth know, too, that he had mended his ways and was willing to go into her father’s office.

Five dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent, the market price for art.  The disappointment of it, the lie of it, the infamy of it, were uppermost in his thoughts; and under his closed eyelids, in fiery figures, burned the “$3.85” he owed the grocer.  He shivered, and was aware of an aching in his bones.  The small of his back ached especially.  His head ached, the top of it ached, the back of it ached, the brains inside of it ached and seemed to be swelling, while the ache over his brows was intolerable.  And beneath the brows, planted under his lids, was the merciless “$3.85.”  He opened his eyes to escape it, but the white light of the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him to close his eyes, when the “$3.85” confronted him again.

Five dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent—that particular thought took up its residence in his brain, and he could no more escape it than he could the “$3.85” under his eyelids.  A change seemed to come over the latter, and he watched curiously, till “$2.00” burned in its stead.  Ah, he thought, that was the baker.  The next sum that appeared was “$2.50.”  It puzzled him, and he pondered it as if life and death hung on the solution.  He owed somebody two dollars and a half, that was certain, but who was it?  To find it was the task set him by an imperious and malignant universe, and he wandered through the endless corridors of his mind, opening all manner of lumber rooms and chambers stored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he vainly sought the answer.  After several centuries it came to him, easily, without effort, that it was Maria.  With a great relief he turned his soul to the screen of torment under his lids.  He had solved the problem; now he could rest.  But no, the “$2.50” faded away, and in its place burned “$8.00.”  Who was that?  He must go the dreary round of his mind again and find out.

How long he was gone on this quest he did not know, but after what seemed an enormous lapse of time, he was called back to himself by a knock at the door, and by Maria’s asking if he was sick.  He replied in a muffled voice he did not recognize, saying that he was merely taking a nap.  He was surprised when he noted the darkness of night in the room.  He had received the letter at two in the afternoon, and he realized that he was sick.

Then the “$8.00” began to smoulder under his lids again, and he returned himself to servitude.  But he grew cunning.  There was no need for him to wander through his mind.  He had been a fool.  He pulled a lever and made his mind revolve about him, a monstrous wheel of fortune, a merry-go-round of memory, a revolving sphere of wisdom.  Faster and faster it revolved, until its vortex sucked him in and he was flung whirling through black chaos.

Quite naturally he found himself at a mangle, feeding starched cuffs.  But as he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs.  It was a new way of marking linen, he thought, until, looking closer, he saw “$3.85” on one of the cuffs.  Then it came to him that it was the grocer’s bill, and that these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle.  A crafty idea came to him.  He would throw the bills on the floor and so escape paying them.  No sooner thought than done, and he crumpled the cuffs spitefully as he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor.  Ever the heap grew, and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times, he found only one for two dollars and a half, which was what he owed Maria.  That meant that Maria would not press for payment, and he resolved generously that it would be the only one he would pay; so he began searching through the cast-out heap for hers.  He sought it desperately, for ages, and was still searching when the manager of the hotel entered, the fat Dutchman.  His face blazed with wrath, and he shouted in stentorian tones that echoed down the universe, “I shall deduct the cost of those cuffs from your wages!”  The pile of cuffs grew into a mountain, and Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a thousand years to pay for them.  Well, there was nothing left to do but kill the manager and burn down the laundry.  But the big Dutchman frustrated him, seizing him by the nape of the neck and dancing him up and down.  He danced him over the ironing tables, the stove, and the mangles, and out into the wash-room and over the wringer and washer.  Martin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head ached, and he marvelled that the Dutchman was so strong.

And then he found himself before the mangle, this time receiving the cuffs an editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side.  Each cuff was a check, and Martin went over them anxiously, in a fever of expectation, but they were all blanks.  He stood there and received the blanks for a million years or so, never letting one go by for fear it might be filled out.  At last he found it.  With trembling fingers he held it to the light.  It was for five dollars.  “Ha! Ha!” laughed the editor across the mangle.  “Well, then, I shall kill you,” Martin said.  He went out into the wash-room to get the axe, and found Joe starching manuscripts.  He tried to make him desist, then swung the axe for him.  But the weapon remained poised in mid-air, for Martin found himself back in the ironing room in the midst of a snow-storm.  No, it was not snow that was falling, but checks of large denomination, the smallest not less than a thousand dollars.  He began to collect them and sort them out, in packages of a hundred, tying each package securely with twine.

He looked up from his task and saw Joe standing before him juggling flat-irons, starched shirts, and manuscripts.  Now and again he reached out and added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared through the roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle.  Martin struck at him, but he seized the axe and added it to the flying circle.  Then he plucked Martin and added him.  Martin went up through the roof, clutching at manuscripts, so that by the time he came down he had a large armful.  But no sooner down than up again, and a second and a third time and countless times he flew around the circle.  From far off he could hear a childish treble singing: “Waltz me around again, Willie, around, around, around.”

He recovered the axe in the midst of the Milky Way of checks, starched shirts, and manuscripts, and prepared, when he came down, to kill Joe.  But he did not come down.  Instead, at two in the morning, Maria, having heard his groans through the thin partition, came into his room, to put hot flat-irons against his body and damp cloths upon his aching eyes.

CHAPTER XXVI

Martin Eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning.  It was late afternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with aching eyes about the room.  Mary, one of the tribe of Silva, eight years old, keeping watch, raised a screech at sight of his returning consciousness.  Maria hurried into the room from the kitchen.  She put her work-calloused hand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse.

“You lika da eat?” she asked.

He shook his head.  Eating was farthest from his desire, and he wondered that he should ever have been hungry in his life.

“I’m sick, Maria,” he said weakly.  “What is it?  Do you know?”

“Grip,” she answered.  “Two or three days you alla da right.  Better you no eat now.  Bimeby plenty can eat, to-morrow can eat maybe.”

Martin was not used to sickness, and when Maria and her little girl left him, he essayed to get up and dress.  By a supreme exertion of will, with rearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep them open, he managed to get out of bed, only to be left stranded by his senses upon the table.  Half an hour later he managed to regain the bed, where he was content to lie with closed eyes and analyze his various pains and weaknesses.  Maria came in several times to change the cold cloths on his forehead.  Otherwise she left him in peace, too wise to vex him with chatter.  This moved him to gratitude, and he murmured to himself, “Maria, you getta da milka ranch, all righta, all right.”

Then he remembered his long-buried past of yesterday.

It seemed a life-time since he had received that letter from the Transcontinental, a life-time since it was all over and done with and a new page turned.  He had shot his bolt, and shot it hard, and now he was down on his back.  If he hadn’t starved himself, he wouldn’t have been caught by La Grippe.  He had been run down, and he had not had the strength to throw off the germ of disease which had invaded his system.  This was what resulted.

“What does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose his own life?” he demanded aloud.  “This is no place for me.  No more literature in mine.  Me for the counting-house and ledger, the monthly salary, and the little home with Ruth.”

Two days later, having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a cup of tea, he asked for his mail, but found his eyes still hurt too much to permit him to read.

“You read for me, Maria,” he said.  “Never mind the big, long letters.  Throw them under the table.  Read me the small letters.”

“No can,” was the answer.  “Teresa, she go to school, she can.”

So Teresa Silva, aged nine, opened his letters and read them to him.  He listened absently to a long dun from the type-writer people, his mind busy with ways and means of finding a job.  Suddenly he was shocked back to himself.

“‘We offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in your story,’” Teresa slowly spelled out, “‘provided you allow us to make the alterations suggested.’”

“What magazine is that?” Martin shouted.  “Here, give it to me!”

He could see to read, now, and he was unaware of the pain of the action.  It was the White Mouse that was offering him forty dollars, and the story was “The Whirlpool,” another of his early horror stories.  He read the letter through again and again.  The editor told him plainly that he had not handled the idea properly, but that it was the idea they were buying because it was original.  If they could cut the story down one-third, they would take it and send him forty dollars on receipt of his answer.

He called for pen and ink, and told the editor he could cut the story down three-thirds if he wanted to, and to send the forty dollars right along.

The letter despatched to the letter-box by Teresa, Martin lay back and thought.  It wasn’t a lie, after all.  The White Mouse paid on acceptance.  There were three thousand words in “The Whirlpool.”  Cut down a third, there would be two thousand.  At forty dollars that would be two cents a word.  Pay on acceptance and two cents a word—the newspapers had told the truth.  And he had thought the White Mouse a third-rater!  It was evident that he did not know the magazines.  He had deemed the Transcontinental a first-rater, and it paid a cent for ten words.  He had classed the White Mouse as of no account, and it paid twenty times as much as the Transcontinental and also had paid on acceptance.

Well, there was one thing certain: when he got well, he would not go out looking for a job.  There were more stories in his head as good as “The Whirlpool,” and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more than in any job or position.  Just when he thought the battle lost, it was won.  He had proved for his career.  The way was clear.  Beginning with the White Mouse he would add magazine after magazine to his growing list of patrons.  Hack-work could be put aside.  For that matter, it had been wasted time, for it had not brought him a dollar.  He would devote himself to work, good work, and he would pour out the best that was in him.  He wished Ruth was there to share in his joy, and when he went over the letters left lying on his bed, he found one from her.  It was sweetly reproachful, wondering what had kept him away for so dreadful a length of time.  He reread the letter adoringly, dwelling over her handwriting, loving each stroke of her pen, and in the end kissing her signature.

And when he answered, he told her recklessly that he had not been to see her because his best clothes were in pawn.  He told her that he had been sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or two weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.

But Ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks.  Besides, her lover was sick.  The next afternoon, accompanied by Arthur, she arrived in the Morse carriage, to the unqualified delight of the Silva tribe and of all the urchins on the street, and to the consternation of Maria.  She boxed the ears of the Silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny front porch, and in more than usual atrocious English tried to apologize for her appearance.  Sleeves rolled up from soap-flecked arms and a wet gunny-sack around her waist told of the task at which she had been caught.  So flustered was she by two such grand young people asking for her lodger, that she forgot to invite them to sit down in the little parlor.  To enter Martin’s room, they passed through the kitchen, warm and moist and steamy from the big washing in progress.  Maria, in her excitement, jammed the bedroom and bedroom-closet doors together, and for five minutes, through the partly open door, clouds of steam, smelling of soap-suds and dirt, poured into the sick chamber.

Ruth succeeded in veering right and left and right again, and in running the narrow passage between table and bed to Martin’s side; but Arthur veered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and pans in the corner where Martin did his cooking.  Arthur did not linger long.  Ruth occupied the only chair, and having done his duty, he went outside and stood by the gate, the centre of seven marvelling Silvas, who watched him as they would have watched a curiosity in a side-show.  All about the carriage were gathered the children from a dozen blocks, waiting and eager for some tragic and terrible dénouement.  Carriages were seen on their street only for weddings and funerals.  Here was neither marriage nor death: therefore, it was something transcending experience and well worth waiting for.

Martin had been wild to see Ruth.  His was essentially a love-nature, and he possessed more than the average man’s need for sympathy.  He was starving for sympathy, which, with him, meant intelligent understanding; and he had yet to learn that Ruth’s sympathy was largely sentimental and tactful, and that it proceeded from gentleness of nature rather than from understanding of the objects of her sympathy.  So it was while Martin held her hand and gladly talked, that her love for him prompted her to press his hand in return, and that her eyes were moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the marks suffering had stamped upon his face.

But while he told her of his two acceptances, of his despair when he received the one from the Transcontinental, and of the corresponding delight with which he received the one from the White Mouse, she did not follow him.  She heard the words he uttered and understood their literal import, but she was not with him in his despair and his delight.  She could not get out of herself.  She was not interested in selling stories to magazines.  What was important to her was matrimony.  She was not aware of it, however, any more than she was aware that her desire that Martin take a position was the instinctive and preparative impulse of motherhood.  She would have blushed had she been told as much in plain, set terms, and next, she might have grown indignant and asserted that her sole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire for him to make the best of himself.  So, while Martin poured out his heart to her, elated with the first success his chosen work in the world had received, she paid heed to his bare words only, gazing now and again about the room, shocked by what she saw.

For the first time Ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty.  Starving lovers had always seemed romantic to her,—but she had had no idea how starving lovers lived.  She had never dreamed it could be like this.  Ever her gaze shifted from the room to him and back again.  The steamy smell of dirty clothes, which had entered with her from the kitchen, was sickening.  Martin must be soaked with it, Ruth concluded, if that awful woman washed frequently.  Such was the contagiousness of degradation.  When she looked at Martin, she seemed to see the smirch left upon him by his surroundings.  She had never seen him unshaven, and the three days’ growth of beard on his face was repulsive to her.  Not alone did it give him the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva house, inside and out, but it seemed to emphasize that animal-like strength of his which she detested.  And here he was, being confirmed in his madness by the two acceptances he took such pride in telling her about.  A little longer and he would have surrendered and gone to work.  Now he would continue on in this horrible house, writing and starving for a few more months.

“What is that smell?” she asked suddenly.

“Some of Maria’s washing smells, I imagine,” was the answer.  “I am growing quite accustomed to them.”

“No, no; not that.  It is something else.  A stale, sickish smell.”

Martin sampled the air before replying.

“I can’t smell anything else, except stale tobacco smoke,” he announced.

“That’s it.  It is terrible.  Why do you smoke so much, Martin?”

“I don’t know, except that I smoke more than usual when I am lonely.  And then, too, it’s such a long-standing habit.  I learned when I was only a youngster.”

“It is not a nice habit, you know,” she reproved.  “It smells to heaven.”

“That’s the fault of the tobacco.  I can afford only the cheapest.  But wait until I get that forty-dollar check.  I’ll use a brand that is not offensive even to the angels.  But that wasn’t so bad, was it, two acceptances in three days?  That forty-five dollars will pay about all my debts.”

“For two years’ work?” she queried.

“No, for less than a week’s work.  Please pass me that book over on the far corner of the table, the account book with the gray cover.”  He opened it and began turning over the pages rapidly.  “Yes, I was right.  Four days for ‘The Ring of Bells,’ two days for ‘The Whirlpool.’  That’s forty-five dollars for a week’s work, one hundred and eighty dollars a month.  That beats any salary I can command.  And, besides, I’m just beginning.  A thousand dollars a month is not too much to buy for you all I want you to have.  A salary of five hundred a month would be too small.  That forty-five dollars is just a starter.  Wait till I get my stride.  Then watch my smoke.”

Ruth misunderstood his slang, and reverted to cigarettes.

“You smoke more than enough as it is, and the brand of tobacco will make no difference.  It is the smoking itself that is not nice, no matter what the brand may be.  You are a chimney, a living volcano, a perambulating smoke-stack, and you are a perfect disgrace, Martin dear, you know you are.”

She leaned toward him, entreaty in her eyes, and as he looked at her delicate face and into her pure, limpid eyes, as of old he was struck with his own unworthiness.

“I wish you wouldn’t smoke any more,” she whispered.  “Please, for—my sake.”

“All right, I won’t,” he cried.  “I’ll do anything you ask, dear love, anything; you know that.”

A great temptation assailed her.  In an insistent way she had caught glimpses of the large, easy-going side of his nature, and she felt sure, if she asked him to cease attempting to write, that he would grant her wish.  In the swift instant that elapsed, the words trembled on her lips.  But she did not utter them.  She was not quite brave enough; she did not quite dare.  Instead, she leaned toward him to meet him, and in his arms murmured:-

“You know, it is really not for my sake, Martin, but for your own.  I am sure smoking hurts you; and besides, it is not good to be a slave to anything, to a drug least of all.”

“I shall always be your slave,” he smiled.

“In which case, I shall begin issuing my commands.”

She looked at him mischievously, though deep down she was already regretting that she had not preferred her largest request.

“I live but to obey, your majesty.”

“Well, then, my first commandment is, Thou shalt not omit to shave every day.  Look how you have scratched my cheek.”

And so it ended in caresses and love-laughter.  But she had made one point, and she could not expect to make more than one at a time.  She felt a woman’s pride in that she had made him stop smoking.  Another time she would persuade him to take a position, for had he not said he would do anything she asked?

She left his side to explore the room, examining the clothes-lines of notes overhead, learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending his wheel under the ceiling, and being saddened by the heap of manuscripts under the table which represented to her just so much wasted time.  The oil-stove won her admiration, but on investigating the food shelves she found them empty.

“Why, you haven’t anything to eat, you poor dear,” she said with tender compassion.  “You must be starving.”

“I store my food in Maria’s safe and in her pantry,” he lied.  “It keeps better there.  No danger of my starving.  Look at that.”

She had come back to his side, and she saw him double his arm at the elbow, the biceps crawling under his shirt-sleeve and swelling into a knot of muscle, heavy and hard.  The sight repelled her.  Sentimentally, she disliked it.  But her pulse, her blood, every fibre of her, loved it and yearned for it, and, in the old, inexplicable way, she leaned toward him, not away from him.  And in the moment that followed, when he crushed her in his arms, the brain of her, concerned with the superficial aspects of life, was in revolt; while the heart of her, the woman of her, concerned with life itself, exulted triumphantly.  It was in moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of her love for Martin, for it was almost a swoon of delight to her to feel his strong arms about her, holding her tightly, hurting her with the grip of their fervor.  At such moments she found justification for her treason to her standards, for her violation of her own high ideals, and, most of all, for her tacit disobedience to her mother and father.  They did not want her to marry this man.  It shocked them that she should love him.  It shocked her, too, sometimes, when she was apart from him, a cool and reasoning creature.  With him, she loved him—in truth, at times a vexed and worried love; but love it was, a love that was stronger than she.

“This La Grippe is nothing,” he was saying.  “It hurts a bit, and gives one a nasty headache, but it doesn’t compare with break-bone fever.”

“Have you had that, too?” she queried absently, intent on the heaven-sent justification she was finding in his arms.

And so, with absent queries, she led him on, till suddenly his words startled her.

He had had the fever in a secret colony of thirty lepers on one of the Hawaiian Islands.

“But why did you go there?” she demanded.

Such royal carelessness of body seemed criminal.

“Because I didn’t know,” he answered.  “I never dreamed of lepers.  When I deserted the schooner and landed on the beach, I headed inland for some place of hiding.  For three days I lived off guavas, ohia-apples, and bananas, all of which grew wild in the jungle.  On the fourth day I found the trail—a mere foot-trail.  It led inland, and it led up.  It was the way I wanted to go, and it showed signs of recent travel.  At one place it ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a knife-edge.  The trail wasn’t three feet wide on the crest, and on either side the ridge fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep.  One man, with plenty of ammunition, could have held it against a hundred thousand.

“It was the only way in to the hiding-place.  Three hours after I found the trail I was there, in a little mountain valley, a pocket in the midst of lava peaks.  The whole place was terraced for taro-patches, fruit trees grew there, and there were eight or ten grass huts.  But as soon as I saw the inhabitants I knew what I’d struck.  One sight of them was enough.”

“What did you do?” Ruth demanded breathlessly, listening, like any Desdemona, appalled and fascinated.

“Nothing for me to do.  Their leader was a kind old fellow, pretty far gone, but he ruled like a king.  He had discovered the little valley and founded the settlement—all of which was against the law.  But he had guns, plenty of ammunition, and those Kanakas, trained to the shooting of wild cattle and wild pig, were dead shots.  No, there wasn’t any running away for Martin Eden.  He stayed—for three months.”

“But how did you escape?”

“I’d have been there yet, if it hadn’t been for a girl there, a half-Chinese, quarter-white, and quarter-Hawaiian.  She was a beauty, poor thing, and well educated.  Her mother, in Honolulu, was worth a million or so.  Well, this girl got me away at last.  Her mother financed the settlement, you see, so the girl wasn’t afraid of being punished for letting me go.  But she made me swear, first, never to reveal the hiding-place; and I never have.  This is the first time I have even mentioned it.  The girl had just the first signs of leprosy.  The fingers of her right hand were slightly twisted, and there was a small spot on her arm.  That was all.  I guess she is dead, now.”

“But weren’t you frightened?  And weren’t you glad to get away without catching that dreadful disease?”

“Well,” he confessed, “I was a bit shivery at first; but I got used to it.  I used to feel sorry for that poor girl, though.  That made me forget to be afraid.  She was such a beauty, in spirit as well as in appearance, and she was only slightly touched; yet she was doomed to lie there, living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly away.  Leprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it.”

“Poor thing,” Ruth murmured softly.  “It’s a wonder she let you get away.”

“How do you mean?” Martin asked unwittingly.

“Because she must have loved you,” Ruth said, still softly.  “Candidly, now, didn’t she?”

Martin’s sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by the indoor life he was living, while the hunger and the sickness had made his face even pale; and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of a blush.  He was opening his mouth to speak, but Ruth shut him off.

“Never mind, don’t answer; it’s not necessary,” she laughed.

But it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter, and that the light in her eyes was cold.  On the spur of the moment it reminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the North Pacific.  And for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes—a gale at night, with a clear sky and under a full moon, the huge seas glinting coldly in the moonlight.  Next, he saw the girl in the leper refuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had let him go.

“She was noble,” he said simply.  “She gave me life.”

That was all of the incident, but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob in her throat, and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the window.  When she turned it back to him, it was composed, and there was no hint of the gale in her eyes.

“I’m such a silly,” she said plaintively.  “But I can’t help it.  I do so love you, Martin, I do, I do.  I shall grow more catholic in time, but at present I can’t help being jealous of those ghosts of the past, and you know your past is full of ghosts.”

“It must be,” she silenced his protest.  “It could not be otherwise.  And there’s poor Arthur motioning me to come.  He’s tired waiting.  And now good-by, dear.”

“There’s some kind of a mixture, put up by the druggists, that helps men to stop the use of tobacco,” she called back from the door, “and I am going to send you some.”

The door closed, but opened again.

“I do, I do,” she whispered to him; and this time she was really gone.

Maria, with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note the texture of Ruth’s garments and the cut of them (a cut unknown that produced an effect mysteriously beautiful), saw her to the carriage.  The crowd of disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared from view, then transferred their stare to Maria, who had abruptly become the most important person on the street.  But it was one of her progeny who blasted Maria’s reputation by announcing that the grand visitors had been for her lodger.  After that Maria dropped back into her old obscurity and Martin began to notice the respectful manner in which he was regarded by the small fry of the neighborhood.  As for Maria, Martin rose in her estimation a full hundred per cent, and had the Portuguese grocer witnessed that afternoon carriage-call he would have allowed Martin an additional three-dollars-and-eighty-five-cents’ worth of credit.

CHAPTER XXVII

The sun of Martin’s good fortune rose.  The day after Ruth’s visit, he received a check for three dollars from a New York scandal weekly in payment for three of his triolets.  Two days later a newspaper published in Chicago accepted his “Treasure Hunters,” promising to pay ten dollars for it on publication.  The price was small, but it was the first article he had written, his very first attempt to express his thought on the printed page.  To cap everything, the adventure serial for boys, his second attempt, was accepted before the end of the week by a juvenile monthly calling itself Youth and Age.  It was true the serial was twenty-one thousand words, and they offered to pay him sixteen dollars on publication, which was something like seventy-five cents a thousand words; but it was equally true that it was the second thing he had attempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly aware of its clumsy worthlessness.

But even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness of mediocrity.  What characterized them was the clumsiness of too great strength—the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes butterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a war-club.  So it was that Martin was glad to sell his early efforts for songs.  He knew them for what they were, and it had not taken him long to acquire this knowledge.  What he pinned his faith to was his later work.  He had striven to be something more than a mere writer of magazine fiction.  He had sought to equip himself with the tools of artistry.  On the other hand, he had not sacrificed strength.  His conscious aim had been to increase his strength by avoiding excess of strength.  Nor had he departed from his love of reality.  His work was realism, though he had endeavored to fuse with it the fancies and beauties of imagination.  What he sought was an impassioned realism, shot through with human aspiration and faith.  What he wanted was life as it was, with all its spirit-groping and soul-reaching left in.

He had discovered, in the course of his reading, two schools of fiction.  One treated of man as a god, ignoring his earthly origin; the other treated of man as a clod, ignoring his heaven-sent dreams and divine possibilities.  Both the god and the clod schools erred, in Martin’s estimation, and erred through too great singleness of sight and purpose.  There was a compromise that approximated the truth, though it flattered not the school of god, while it challenged the brute-savageness of the school of clod.  It was his story, “Adventure,” which had dragged with Ruth, that Martin believed had achieved his ideal of the true in fiction; and it was in an essay, “God and Clod,” that he had expressed his views on the whole general subject.

But “Adventure,” and all that he deemed his best work, still went begging among the editors.  His early work counted for nothing in his eyes except for the money it brought, and his horror stories, two of which he had sold, he did not consider high work nor his best work.  To him they were frankly imaginative and fantastic, though invested with all the glamour of the real, wherein lay their power.  This investiture of the grotesque and impossible with reality, he looked upon as a trick—a skilful trick at best.  Great literature could not reside in such a field.  Their artistry was high, but he denied the worthwhileness of artistry when divorced from humanness.  The trick had been to fling over the face of his artistry a mask of humanness, and this he had done in the half-dozen or so stories of the horror brand he had written before he emerged upon the high peaks of “Adventure,” “Joy,” “The Pot,” and “The Wine of Life.”

The three dollars he received for the triolets he used to eke out a precarious existence against the arrival of the White Mouse check.  He cashed the first check with the suspicious Portuguese grocer, paying a dollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the baker and the fruit store.  Martin was not yet rich enough to afford meat, and he was on slim allowance when the White Mouse check arrived.  He was divided on the cashing of it.  He had never been in a bank in his life, much less been in one on business, and he had a naive and childlike desire to walk into one of the big banks down in Oakland and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars.  On the other hand, practical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and thereby make an impression that would later result in an increase of credit.  Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer, paying his bill with him in full, and receiving in change a pocketful of jingling coin.  Also, he paid the other tradesmen in full, redeemed his suit and his bicycle, paid one month’s rent on the type-writer, and paid Maria the overdue month for his room and a month in advance.  This left him in his pocket, for emergencies, a balance of nearly three dollars.

In itself, this small sum seemed a fortune.  Immediately on recovering his clothes he had gone to see Ruth, and on the way he could not refrain from jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket.  He had been so long without money that, like a rescued starving man who cannot let the unconsumed food out of his sight, Martin could not keep his hand off the silver.  He was not mean, nor avaricious, but the money meant more than so many dollars and cents.  It stood for success, and the eagles stamped upon the coins were to him so many winged victories.

It came to him insensibly that it was a very good world.  It certainly appeared more beautiful to him.  For weeks it had been a very dull and sombre world; but now, with nearly all debts paid, three dollars jingling in his pocket, and in his mind the consciousness of success, the sun shone bright and warm, and even a rain-squall that soaked unprepared pedestrians seemed a merry happening to him.  When he starved, his thoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he knew were starving the world over; but now that he was feasted full, the fact of the thousands starving was no longer pregnant in his brain.  He forgot about them, and, being in love, remembered the countless lovers in the world.  Without deliberately thinking about it, motifs for love-lyrics began to agitate his brain.  Swept away by the creative impulse, he got off the electric car, without vexation, two blocks beyond his crossing.

He found a number of persons in the Morse home.  Ruth’s two girl-cousins were visiting her from San Rafael, and Mrs. Morse, under pretext of entertaining them, was pursuing her plan of surrounding Ruth with young people.  The campaign had begun during Martin’s enforced absence, and was already in full swing.  She was making a point of having at the house men who were doing things.  Thus, in addition to the cousins Dorothy and Florence, Martin encountered two university professors, one of Latin, the other of English; a young army officer just back from the Philippines, one-time school-mate of Ruth’s; a young fellow named Melville, private secretary to Joseph Perkins, head of the San Francisco Trust Company; and finally of the men, a live bank cashier, Charles Hapgood, a youngish man of thirty-five, graduate of Stanford University, member of the Nile Club and the Unity Club, and a conservative speaker for the Republican Party during campaigns—in short, a rising young man in every way.  Among the women was one who painted portraits, another who was a professional musician, and still another who possessed the degree of Doctor of Sociology and who was locally famous for her social settlement work in the slums of San Francisco.  But the women did not count for much in Mrs. Morse’s plan.  At the best, they were necessary accessories.  The men who did things must be drawn to the house somehow.

“Don’t get excited when you talk,” Ruth admonished Martin, before the ordeal of introduction began.

He bore himself a bit stiffly at first, oppressed by a sense of his own awkwardness, especially of his shoulders, which were up to their old trick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments.  Also, he was rendered self-conscious by the company.  He had never before been in contact with such exalted beings nor with so many of them.  Melville, the bank cashier, fascinated him, and he resolved to investigate him at the first opportunity.  For underneath Martin’s awe lurked his assertive ego, and he felt the urge to measure himself with these men and women and to find out what they had learned from the books and life which he had not learned.

Ruth’s eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on, and she was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got acquainted with her cousins.  He certainly did not grow excited, while being seated removed from him the worry of his shoulders.  Ruth knew them for clever girls, superficially brilliant, and she could scarcely understand their praise of Martin later that night at going to bed.  But he, on the other hand, a wit in his own class, a gay quizzer and laughter-maker at dances and Sunday picnics, had found the making of fun and the breaking of good-natured lances simple enough in this environment.  And on this evening success stood at his back, patting him on the shoulder and telling him that he was making good, so that he could afford to laugh and make laughter and remain unabashed.

Later, Ruth’s anxiety found justification.  Martin and Professor Caldwell had got together in a conspicuous corner, and though Martin no longer wove the air with his hands, to Ruth’s critical eye he permitted his own eyes to flash and glitter too frequently, talked too rapidly and warmly, grew too intense, and allowed his aroused blood to redden his cheeks too much.  He lacked decorum and control, and was in decided contrast to the young professor of English with whom he talked.

But Martin was not concerned with appearances!  He had been swift to note the other’s trained mind and to appreciate his command of knowledge.  Furthermore, Professor Caldwell did not realize Martin’s concept of the average English professor.  Martin wanted him to talk shop, and, though he seemed averse at first, succeeded in making him do it.  For Martin did not see why a man should not talk shop.

“It’s absurd and unfair,” he had told Ruth weeks before, “this objection to talking shop.  For what reason under the sun do men and women come together if not for the exchange of the best that is in them?  And the best that is in them is what they are interested in, the thing by which they make their living, the thing they’ve specialized on and sat up days and nights over, and even dreamed about.  Imagine Mr. Butler living up to social etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul Verlaine or the German drama or the novels of D’Annunzio.  We’d be bored to death.  I, for one, if I must listen to Mr. Butler, prefer to hear him talk about his law.  It’s the best that is in him, and life is so short that I want the best of every man and woman I meet.”

“But,” Ruth had objected, “there are the topics of general interest to all.”

“There, you mistake,” he had rushed on.  “All persons in society, all cliques in society—or, rather, nearly all persons and cliques—ape their betters.  Now, who are the best betters?  The idlers, the wealthy idlers.  They do not know, as a rule, the things known by the persons who are doing something in the world.  To listen to conversation about such things would mean to be bored, wherefore the idlers decree that such things are shop and must not be talked about.  Likewise they decree the things that are not shop and which may be talked about, and those things are the latest operas, latest novels, cards, billiards, cocktails, automobiles, horse shows, trout fishing, tuna-fishing, big-game shooting, yacht sailing, and so forth—and mark you, these are the things the idlers know.  In all truth, they constitute the shop-talk of the idlers.  And the funniest part of it is that many of the clever people, and all the would-be clever people, allow the idlers so to impose upon them.  As for me, I want the best a man’s got in him, call it shop vulgarity or anything you please.”

And Ruth had not understood.  This attack of his on the established had seemed to her just so much wilfulness of opinion.

So Martin contaminated Professor Caldwell with his own earnestness, challenging him to speak his mind.  As Ruth paused beside them she heard Martin saying:-

“You surely don’t pronounce such heresies in the University of California?”

Professor Caldwell shrugged his shoulders.  “The honest taxpayer and the politician, you know.  Sacramento gives us our appropriations and therefore we kowtow to Sacramento, and to the Board of Regents, and to the party press, or to the press of both parties.”

“Yes, that’s clear; but how about you?” Martin urged.  “You must be a fish out of the water.”

“Few like me, I imagine, in the university pond.  Sometimes I am fairly sure I am out of water, and that I should belong in Paris, in Grub Street, in a hermit’s cave, or in some sadly wild Bohemian crowd, drinking claret,—dago-red they call it in San Francisco,—dining in cheap restaurants in the Latin Quarter, and expressing vociferously radical views upon all creation.  Really, I am frequently almost sure that I was cut out to be a radical.  But then, there are so many questions on which I am not sure.  I grow timid when I am face to face with my human frailty, which ever prevents me from grasping all the factors in any problem—human, vital problems, you know.”

And as he talked on, Martin became aware that to his own lips had come the “Song of the Trade Wind”:-

“I am strongest at noon,
But under the moon
I stiffen the bunt of the sail.”

He was almost humming the words, and it dawned upon him that the other reminded him of the trade wind, of the Northeast Trade, steady, and cool, and strong.  He was equable, he was to be relied upon, and withal there was a certain bafflement about him.  Martin had the feeling that he never spoke his full mind, just as he had often had the feeling that the trades never blew their strongest but always held reserves of strength that were never used.  Martin’s trick of visioning was active as ever.  His brain was a most accessible storehouse of remembered fact and fancy, and its contents seemed ever ordered and spread for his inspection.  Whatever occurred in the instant present, Martin’s mind immediately presented associated antithesis or similitude which ordinarily expressed themselves to him in vision.  It was sheerly automatic, and his visioning was an unfailing accompaniment to the living present.  Just as Ruth’s face, in a momentary jealousy had called before his eyes a forgotten moonlight gale, and as Professor Caldwell made him see again the Northeast Trade herding the white billows across the purple sea, so, from moment to moment, not disconcerting but rather identifying and classifying, new memory-visions rose before him, or spread under his eyelids, or were thrown upon the screen of his consciousness.  These visions came out of the actions and sensations of the past, out of things and events and books of yesterday and last week—a countless host of apparitions that, waking or sleeping, forever thronged his mind.

So it was, as he listened to Professor Caldwell’s easy flow of speech—the conversation of a clever, cultured man—that Martin kept seeing himself down all his past.  He saw himself when he had been quite the hoodlum, wearing a “stiff-rim” Stetson hat and a square-cut, double-breasted coat, with a certain swagger to the shoulders and possessing the ideal of being as tough as the police permitted.  He did not disguise it to himself, nor attempt to palliate it.  At one time in his life he had been just a common hoodlum, the leader of a gang that worried the police and terrorized honest, working-class householders.  But his ideals had changed.  He glanced about him at the well-bred, well-dressed men and women, and breathed into his lungs the atmosphere of culture and refinement, and at the same moment the ghost of his early youth, in stiff-rim and square-cut, with swagger and toughness, stalked across the room.  This figure, of the corner hoodlum, he saw merge into himself, sitting and talking with an actual university professor.

For, after all, he had never found his permanent abiding place.  He had fitted in wherever he found himself, been a favorite always and everywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his willingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect.  But he had never taken root.  He had fitted in sufficiently to satisfy his fellows but not to satisfy himself.  He had been perturbed always by a feeling of unrest, had heard always the call of something from beyond, and had wandered on through life seeking it until he found books and art and love.  And here he was, in the midst of all this, the only one of all the comrades he had adventured with who could have made themselves eligible for the inside of the Morse home.

But such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following Professor Caldwell closely.  And as he followed, comprehendingly and critically, he noted the unbroken field of the other’s knowledge.  As for himself, from moment to moment the conversation showed him gaps and open stretches, whole subjects with which he was unfamiliar.  Nevertheless, thanks to his Spencer, he saw that he possessed the outlines of the field of knowledge.  It was a matter only of time, when he would fill in the outline.  Then watch out, he thought—’ware shoal, everybody!  He felt like sitting at the feet of the professor, worshipful and absorbent; but, as he listened, he began to discern a weakness in the other’s judgments—a weakness so stray and elusive that he might not have caught it had it not been ever present.  And when he did catch it, he leapt to equality at once.

Ruth came up to them a second time, just as Martin began to speak.

“I’ll tell you where you are wrong, or, rather, what weakens your judgments,” he said.  “You lack biology.  It has no place in your scheme of things.—Oh, I mean the real interpretative biology, from the ground up, from the laboratory and the test-tube and the vitalized inorganic right on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations.”

Ruth was appalled.  She had sat two lecture courses under Professor Caldwell and looked up to him as the living repository of all knowledge.

“I scarcely follow you,” he said dubiously.

Martin was not so sure but what he had followed him.

“Then I’ll try to explain,” he said.  “I remember reading in Egyptian history something to the effect that understanding could not be had of Egyptian art without first studying the land question.”

“Quite right,” the professor nodded.

“And it seems to me,” Martin continued, “that knowledge of the land question, in turn, of all questions, for that matter, cannot be had without previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life.  How can we understand laws and institutions, religions and customs, without understanding, not merely the nature of the creatures that made them, but the nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made?  Is literature less human than the architecture and sculpture of Egypt?  Is there one thing in the known universe that is not subject to the law of evolution?—Oh, I know there is an elaborate evolution of the various arts laid down, but it seems to me to be too mechanical.  The human himself is left out.  The evolution of the tool, of the harp, of music and song and dance, are all beautifully elaborated; but how about the evolution of the human himself, the development of the basic and intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or gibbered his first chant?  It is that which you do not consider, and which I call biology.  It is biology in its largest aspects.

“I know I express myself incoherently, but I’ve tried to hammer out the idea.  It came to me as you were talking, so I was not primed and ready to deliver it.  You spoke yourself of the human frailty that prevented one from taking all the factors into consideration.  And you, in turn,—or so it seems to me,—leave out the biological factor, the very stuff out of which has been spun the fabric of all the arts, the warp and the woof of all human actions and achievements.”

To Ruth’s amazement, Martin was not immediately crushed, and that the professor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for Martin’s youth.  Professor Caldwell sat for a full minute, silent and fingering his watch chain.

“Do you know,” he said at last, “I’ve had that same criticism passed on me once before—by a very great man, a scientist and evolutionist, Joseph Le Conte.  But he is dead, and I thought to remain undetected; and now you come along and expose me.  Seriously, though—and this is confession—I think there is something in your contention—a great deal, in fact.  I am too classical, not enough up-to-date in the interpretative branches of science, and I can only plead the disadvantages of my education and a temperamental slothfulness that prevents me from doing the work.  I wonder if you’ll believe that I’ve never been inside a physics or chemistry laboratory?  It is true, nevertheless.  Le Conte was right, and so are you, Mr. Eden, at least to an extent—how much I do not know.”

Ruth drew Martin away with her on a pretext; when she had got him aside, whispering:-

“You shouldn’t have monopolized Professor Caldwell that way.  There may be others who want to talk with him.”

“My mistake,” Martin admitted contritely.  “But I’d got him stirred up, and he was so interesting that I did not think.  Do you know, he is the brightest, the most intellectual, man I have ever talked with.  And I’ll tell you something else.  I once thought that everybody who went to universities, or who sat in the high places in society, was just as brilliant and intelligent as he.”

“He’s an exception,” she answered.

“I should say so.  Whom do you want me to talk to now?—Oh, say, bring me up against that cashier-fellow.”

Martin talked for fifteen minutes with him, nor could Ruth have wished better behavior on her lover’s part.  Not once did his eyes flash nor his cheeks flush, while the calmness and poise with which he talked surprised her.  But in Martin’s estimation the whole tribe of bank cashiers fell a few hundred per cent, and for the rest of the evening he labored under the impression that bank cashiers and talkers of platitudes were synonymous phrases.  The army officer he found good-natured and simple, a healthy, wholesome young fellow, content to occupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung him.  On learning that he had completed two years in the university, Martin was puzzled to know where he had stored it away.  Nevertheless Martin liked him better than the platitudinous bank cashier.

“I really don’t object to platitudes,” he told Ruth later; “but what worries me into nervousness is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior certitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it.  Why, I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he took to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the Democrats.  Do you know, he skins his words as a professional poker-player skins the cards that are dealt out to him.  Some day I’ll show you what I mean.”

“I’m sorry you don’t like him,” was her reply.  “He’s a favorite of Mr. Butler’s.  Mr. Butler says he is safe and honest—calls him the Rock, Peter, and says that upon him any banking institution can well be built.”

“I don’t doubt it—from the little I saw of him and the less I heard from him; but I don’t think so much of banks as I did.  You don’t mind my speaking my mind this way, dear?”

“No, no; it is most interesting.”

“Yes,” Martin went on heartily, “I’m no more than a barbarian getting my first impressions of civilization.  Such impressions must be entertainingly novel to the civilized person.”

“What did you think of my cousins?” Ruth queried.

“I liked them better than the other women.  There’s plenty of fun in them along with paucity of pretence.”

“Then you did like the other women?”

He shook his head.

“That social-settlement woman is no more than a sociological poll-parrot.  I swear, if you winnowed her out between the stars, like Tomlinson, there would be found in her not one original thought.  As for the portrait-painter, she was a positive bore.  She’d make a good wife for the cashier.  And the musician woman!  I don’t care how nimble her fingers are, how perfect her technique, how wonderful her expression—the fact is, she knows nothing about music.”

“She plays beautifully,” Ruth protested.

“Yes, she’s undoubtedly gymnastic in the externals of music, but the intrinsic spirit of music is unguessed by her.  I asked her what music meant to her—you know I’m always curious to know that particular thing; and she did not know what it meant to her, except that she adored it, that it was the greatest of the arts, and that it meant more than life to her.”

“You were making them talk shop,” Ruth charged him.

“I confess it.  And if they were failures on shop, imagine my sufferings if they had discoursed on other subjects.  Why, I used to think that up here, where all the advantages of culture were enjoyed—”  He paused for a moment, and watched the youthful shade of himself, in stiff-rim and square-cut, enter the door and swagger across the room.  “As I was saying, up here I thought all men and women were brilliant and radiant.  But now, from what little I’ve seen of them, they strike me as a pack of ninnies, most of them, and ninety percent of the remainder as bores.  Now there’s Professor Caldwell—he’s different.  He’s a man, every inch of him and every atom of his gray matter.”

Ruth’s face brightened.

“Tell me about him,” she urged.  “Not what is large and brilliant—I know those qualities; but whatever you feel is adverse.  I am most curious to know.”

“Perhaps I’ll get myself in a pickle.”  Martin debated humorously for a moment.  “Suppose you tell me first.  Or maybe you find in him nothing less than the best.”

“I attended two lecture courses under him, and I have known him for two years; that is why I am anxious for your first impression.”

“Bad impression, you mean?  Well, here goes.  He is all the fine things you think about him, I guess.  At least, he is the finest specimen of intellectual man I have met; but he is a man with a secret shame.”

“Oh, no, no!” he hastened to cry.  “Nothing paltry nor vulgar.  What I mean is that he strikes me as a man who has gone to the bottom of things, and is so afraid of what he saw that he makes believe to himself that he never saw it.  Perhaps that’s not the clearest way to express it.  Here’s another way.  A man who has found the path to the hidden temple but has not followed it; who has, perhaps, caught glimpses of the temple and striven afterward to convince himself that it was only a mirage of foliage.  Yet another way.  A man who could have done things but who placed no value on the doing, and who, all the time, in his innermost heart, is regretting that he has not done them; who has secretly laughed at the rewards for doing, and yet, still more secretly, has yearned for the rewards and for the joy of doing.”

“I don’t read him that way,” she said.  “And for that matter, I don’t see just what you mean.”

“It is only a vague feeling on my part,” Martin temporized.  “I have no reason for it.  It is only a feeling, and most likely it is wrong.  You certainly should know him better than I.”

From the evening at Ruth’s Martin brought away with him strange confusions and conflicting feelings.  He was disappointed in his goal, in the persons he had climbed to be with.  On the other hand, he was encouraged with his success.  The climb had been easier than he expected.  He was superior to the climb, and (he did not, with false modesty, hide it from himself) he was superior to the beings among whom he had climbed—with the exception, of course, of Professor Caldwell.  About life and the books he knew more than they, and he wondered into what nooks and crannies they had cast aside their educations.  He did not know that he was himself possessed of unusual brain vigor; nor did he know that the persons who were given to probing the depths and to thinking ultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing rooms of the world’s Morses; nor did he dream that such persons were as lonely eagles sailing solitary in the azure sky far above the earth and its swarming freight of gregarious life.

CHAPTER XXVIII

But success had lost Martin’s address, and her messengers no longer came to his door.  For twenty-five days, working Sundays and holidays, he toiled on “The Shame of the Sun,” a long essay of some thirty thousand words.  It was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the Maeterlinck school—an attack from the citadel of positive science upon the wonder-dreamers, but an attack nevertheless that retained much of beauty and wonder of the sort compatible with ascertained fact.  It was a little later that he followed up the attack with two short essays, “The Wonder-Dreamers” and “The Yardstick of the Ego.”  And on essays, long and short, he began to pay the travelling expenses from magazine to magazine.

During the twenty-five days spent on “The Shame of the Sun,” he sold hack-work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents.  A joke had brought in fifty cents, and a second one, sold to a high-grade comic weekly, had fetched a dollar.  Then two humorous poems had earned two dollars and three dollars respectively.  As a result, having exhausted his credit with the tradesmen (though he had increased his credit with the grocer to five dollars), his wheel and suit of clothes went back to the pawnbroker.  The type-writer people were again clamoring for money, insistently pointing out that according to the agreement rent was to be paid strictly in advance.

Encouraged by his several small sales, Martin went back to hack-work.  Perhaps there was a living in it, after all.  Stored away under his table were the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the newspaper short-story syndicate.  He read them over in order to find out how not to write newspaper storiettes, and so doing, reasoned out the perfect formula.  He found that the newspaper storiette should never be tragic, should never end unhappily, and should never contain beauty of language, subtlety of thought, nor real delicacy of sentiment.  Sentiment it must contain, plenty of it, pure and noble, of the sort that in his own early youth had brought his applause from “nigger heaven”—the “For-God-my-country-and-the-Czar” and “I-may-be-poor-but-I-am-honest” brand of sentiment.

Having learned such precautions, Martin consulted “The Duchess” for tone, and proceeded to mix according to formula.  The formula consists of three parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed or event they are reunited; (3) marriage bells.  The third part was an unvarying quantity, but the first and second parts could be varied an infinite number of times.  Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming relative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl’s heart, by lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly.  It was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being reunited, and Martin discovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses.  But marriage bells at the end was the one thing he could take no liberties with; though the heavens rolled up as a scroll and the stars fell, the wedding bells must go on ringing just the same.  In quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose, fifteen hundred words maximum dose.

Before he got very far along in the art of the storiette, Martin worked out half a dozen stock forms, which he always consulted when constructing storiettes.  These forms were like the cunning tables used by mathematicians, which may be entered from top, bottom, right, and left, which entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns, and from which may be drawn, without reasoning or thinking, thousands of different conclusions, all unchallengably precise and true.  Thus, in the course of half an hour with his forms, Martin could frame up a dozen or so storiettes, which he put aside and filled in at his convenience.  He found that he could fill one in, after a day of serious work, in the hour before going to bed.  As he later confessed to Ruth, he could almost do it in his sleep.  The real work was in constructing the frames, and that was merely mechanical.

He had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula, and for once he knew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the first two he sent off would bring checks.  And checks they brought, for four dollars each, at the end of twelve days.

In the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning the magazines.  Though the Transcontinental had published “The Ring of Bells,” no check was forthcoming.  Martin needed it, and he wrote for it.  An evasive answer and a request for more of his work was all he received.  He had gone hungry two days waiting for the reply, and it was then that he put his wheel back in pawn.  He wrote regularly, twice a week, to the Transcontinental for his five dollars, though it was only semi-occasionally that he elicited a reply.  He did not know that the Transcontinental had been staggering along precariously for years, that it was a fourth-rater, or tenth-rater, without standing, with a crazy circulation that partly rested on petty bullying and partly on patriotic appealing, and with advertisements that were scarcely more than charitable donations.  Nor did he know that the Transcontinental was the sole livelihood of the editor and the business manager, and that they could wring their livelihood out of it only by moving to escape paying rent and by never paying any bill they could evade.  Nor could he have guessed that the particular five dollars that belonged to him had been appropriated by the business manager for the painting of his house in Alameda, which painting he performed himself, on week-day afternoons, because he could not afford to pay union wages and because the first scab he had employed had had a ladder jerked out from under him and been sent to the hospital with a broken collar-bone.

The ten dollars for which Martin had sold “Treasure Hunters” to the Chicago newspaper did not come to hand.  The article had been published, as he had ascertained at the file in the Central Reading-room, but no word could he get from the editor.  His letters were ignored.  To satisfy himself that they had been received, he registered several of them.  It was nothing less than robbery, he concluded—a cold-blooded steal; while he starved, he was pilfered of his merchandise, of his goods, the sale of which was the sole way of getting bread to eat.

Youth and Age was a weekly, and it had published two-thirds of his twenty-one-thousand-word serial when it went out of business.  With it went all hopes of getting his sixteen dollars.

To cap the situation, “The Pot,” which he looked upon as one of the best things he had written, was lost to him.  In despair, casting about frantically among the magazines, he had sent it to The Billow, a society weekly in San Francisco.  His chief reason for submitting it to that publication was that, having only to travel across the bay from Oakland, a quick decision could be reached.  Two weeks later he was overjoyed to see, in the latest number on the news-stand, his story printed in full, illustrated, and in the place of honor.  He went home with leaping pulse, wondering how much they would pay him for one of the best things he had done.  Also, the celerity with which it had been accepted and published was a pleasant thought to him.  That the editor had not informed him of the acceptance made the surprise more complete.  After waiting a week, two weeks, and half a week longer, desperation conquered diffidence, and he wrote to the editor of The Billow, suggesting that possibly through some negligence of the business manager his little account had been overlooked.

Even if it isn’t more than five dollars, Martin thought to himself, it will buy enough beans and pea-soup to enable me to write half a dozen like it, and possibly as good.

Back came a cool letter from the editor that at least elicited Martin’s admiration.

“We thank you,” it ran, “for your excellent contribution.  All of us in the office enjoyed it immensely, and, as you see, it was given the place of honor and immediate publication.  We earnestly hope that you liked the illustrations.

“On rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring under the misapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts.  This is not our custom, and of course yours was unsolicited.  We assumed, naturally, when we received your story, that you understood the situation.  We can only deeply regret this unfortunate misunderstanding, and assure you of our unfailing regard.  Again, thanking you for your kind contribution, and hoping to receive more from you in the near future, we remain, etc.”

There was also a postscript to the effect that though The Billow carried no free-list, it took great pleasure in sending him a complimentary subscription for the ensuing year.

After that experience, Martin typed at the top of the first sheet of all his manuscripts: “Submitted at your usual rate.”

Some day, he consoled himself, they will be submitted at my usual rate.

He discovered in himself, at this period, a passion for perfection, under the sway of which he rewrote and polished “The Jostling Street,” “The Wine of Life,” “Joy,” the “Sea Lyrics,” and others of his earlier work.  As of old, nineteen hours of labor a day was all too little to suit him.  He wrote prodigiously, and he read prodigiously, forgetting in his toil the pangs caused by giving up his tobacco.  Ruth’s promised cure for the habit, flamboyantly labelled, he stowed away in the most inaccessible corner of his bureau.  Especially during his stretches of famine he suffered from lack of the weed; but no matter how often he mastered the craving, it remained with him as strong as ever.  He regarded it as the biggest thing he had ever achieved.  Ruth’s point of view was that he was doing no more than was right.  She brought him the anti-tobacco remedy, purchased out of her glove money, and in a few days forgot all about it.

His machine-made storiettes, though he hated them and derided them, were successful.  By means of them he redeemed all his pledges, paid most of his bills, and bought a new set of tires for his wheel.  The storiettes at least kept the pot a-boiling and gave him time for ambitious work; while the one thing that upheld him was the forty dollars he had received from The White Mouse.  He anchored his faith to that, and was confident that the really first-class magazines would pay an unknown writer at least an equal rate, if not a better one.  But the thing was, how to get into the first-class magazines.  His best stories, essays, and poems went begging among them, and yet, each month, he read reams of dull, prosy, inartistic stuff between all their various covers.  If only one editor, he sometimes thought, would descend from his high seat of pride to write me one cheering line!  No matter if my work is unusual, no matter if it is unfit, for prudential reasons, for their pages, surely there must be some sparks in it, somewhere, a few, to warm them to some sort of appreciation.  And thereupon he would get out one or another of his manuscripts, such as “Adventure,” and read it over and over in a vain attempt to vindicate the editorial silence.

As the sweet California spring came on, his period of plenty came to an end.  For several weeks he had been worried by a strange silence on the part of the newspaper storiette syndicate.  Then, one day, came back to him through the mail ten of his immaculate machine-made storiettes.  They were accompanied by a brief letter to the effect that the syndicate was overstocked, and that some months would elapse before it would be in the market again for manuscripts.  Martin had even been extravagant on the strength of those ten storiettes.  Toward the last the syndicate had been paying him five dollars each for them and accepting every one he sent.  So he had looked upon the ten as good as sold, and he had lived accordingly, on a basis of fifty dollars in the bank.  So it was that he entered abruptly upon a lean period, wherein he continued selling his earlier efforts to publications that would not pay and submitting his later work to magazines that would not buy.  Also, he resumed his trips to the pawn-broker down in Oakland.  A few jokes and snatches of humorous verse, sold to the New York weeklies, made existence barely possible for him.  It was at this time that he wrote letters of inquiry to the several great monthly and quarterly reviews, and learned in reply that they rarely considered unsolicited articles, and that most of their contents were written upon order by well-known specialists who were authorities in their various fields.

CHAPTER XXIX

It was a hard summer for Martin.  Manuscript readers and editors were away on vacation, and publications that ordinarily returned a decision in three weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more.  The consolation he drew from it was that a saving in postage was effected by the deadlock.  Only the robber-publications seemed to remain actively in business, and to them Martin disposed of all his early efforts, such as “Pearl-diving,” “The Sea as a Career,” “Turtle-catching,” and “The Northeast Trades.”  For these manuscripts he never received a penny.  It is true, after six months’ correspondence, he effected a compromise, whereby he received a safety razor for “Turtle-catching,” and that The Acropolis, having agreed to give him five dollars cash and five yearly subscriptions: for “The Northeast Trades,” fulfilled the second part of the agreement.

For a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a Boston editor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste and a penny-dreadful purse.  “The Peri and the Pearl,” a clever skit of a poem of two hundred lines, just finished, white hot from his brain, won the heart of the editor of a San Francisco magazine published in the interest of a great railroad.  When the editor wrote, offering him payment in transportation, Martin wrote back to inquire if the transportation was transferable.  It was not, and so, being prevented from peddling it, he asked for the return of the poem.  Back it came, with the editor’s regrets, and Martin sent it to San Francisco again, this time to The Hornet, a pretentious monthly that had been fanned into a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist who founded it.  But The Hornet’s light had begun to dim long before Martin was born.  The editor promised Martin fifteen dollars for the poem, but, when it was published, seemed to forget about it.  Several of his letters being ignored, Martin indicted an angry one which drew a reply.  It was written by a new editor, who coolly informed Martin that he declined to be held responsible for the old editor’s mistakes, and that he did not think much of “The Peri and the Pearl” anyway.

But The Globe, a Chicago magazine, gave Martin the most cruel treatment of all.  He had refrained from offering his “Sea Lyrics” for publication, until driven to it by starvation.  After having been rejected by a dozen magazines, they had come to rest in The Globe office.  There were thirty poems in the collection, and he was to receive a dollar apiece for them.  The first month four were published, and he promptly received a cheek for four dollars; but when he looked over the magazine, he was appalled at the slaughter.  In some cases the titles had been altered: “Finis,” for instance, being changed to “The Finish,” and “The Song of the Outer Reef” to “The Song of the Coral Reef.”  In one case, an absolutely different title, a misappropriate title, was substituted.  In place of his own, “Medusa Lights,” the editor had printed, “The Backward Track.”  But the slaughter in the body of the poems was terrifying.  Martin groaned and sweated and thrust his hands through his hair.  Phrases, lines, and stanzas were cut out, interchanged, or juggled about in the most incomprehensible manner.  Sometimes lines and stanzas not his own were substituted for his.  He could not believe that a sane editor could be guilty of such maltreatment, and his favorite hypothesis was that his poems must have been doctored by the office boy or the stenographer.  Martin wrote immediately, begging the editor to cease publishing the lyrics and to return them to him.

He wrote again and again, begging, entreating, threatening, but his letters were ignored.  Month by month the slaughter went on till the thirty poems were published, and month by month he received a check for those which had appeared in the current number.

Despite these various misadventures, the memory of the White Mouse forty-dollar check sustained him, though he was driven more and more to hack-work.  He discovered a bread-and-butter field in the agricultural weeklies and trade journals, though among the religious weeklies he found he could easily starve.  At his lowest ebb, when his black suit was in pawn, he made a ten-strike—or so it seemed to him—in a prize contest arranged by the County Committee of the Republican Party.  There were three branches of the contest, and he entered them all, laughing at himself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits to live.  His poem won the first prize of ten dollars, his campaign song the second prize of five dollars, his essay on the principles of the Republican Party the first prize of twenty-five dollars.  Which was very gratifying to him until he tried to collect.  Something had gone wrong in the County Committee, and, though a rich banker and a state senator were members of it, the money was not forthcoming.  While this affair was hanging fire, he proved that he understood the principles of the Democratic Party by winning the first prize for his essay in a similar contest.  And, moreover, he received the money, twenty-five dollars.  But the forty dollars won in the first contest he never received.

Driven to shifts in order to see Ruth, and deciding that the long walk from north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time, he kept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle.  The latter gave him exercise, saved him hours of time for work, and enabled him to see Ruth just the same.  A pair of knee duck trousers and an old sweater made him a presentable wheel costume, so that he could go with Ruth on afternoon rides.  Besides, he no longer had opportunity to see much of her in her own home, where Mrs. Morse was thoroughly prosecuting her campaign of entertainment.  The exalted beings he met there, and to whom he had looked up but a short time before, now bored him.  They were no longer exalted.  He was nervous and irritable, what of his hard times, disappointments, and close application to work, and the conversation of such people was maddening.  He was not unduly egotistic.  He measured the narrowness of their minds by the minds of the thinkers in the books he read.  At Ruth’s home he never met a large mind, with the exception of Professor Caldwell, and Caldwell he had met there only once.  As for the rest, they were numskulls, ninnies, superficial, dogmatic, and ignorant.  It was their ignorance that astounded him.  What was the matter with them?  What had they done with their educations?  They had had access to the same books he had.  How did it happen that they had drawn nothing from them?

He knew that the great minds, the deep and rational thinkers, existed.  He had his proofs from the books, the books that had educated him beyond the Morse standard.  And he knew that higher intellects than those of the Morse circle were to be found in the world.  He read English society novels, wherein he caught glimpses of men and women talking politics and philosophy.  And he read of salons in great cities, even in the United States, where art and intellect congregated.  Foolishly, in the past, he had conceived that all well-groomed persons above the working class were persons with power of intellect and vigor of beauty.  Culture and collars had gone together, to him, and he had been deceived into believing that college educations and mastery were the same things.

Well, he would fight his way on and up higher.  And he would take Ruth with him.  Her he dearly loved, and he was confident that she would shine anywhere.  As it was clear to him that he had been handicapped by his early environment, so now he perceived that she was similarly handicapped.  She had not had a chance to expand.  The books on her father’s shelves, the paintings on the walls, the music on the piano—all was just so much meretricious display.  To real literature, real painting, real music, the Morses and their kind, were dead.  And bigger than such things was life, of which they were densely, hopelessly ignorant.  In spite of their Unitarian proclivities and their masks of conservative broadmindedness, they were two generations behind interpretative science: their mental processes were mediaeval, while their thinking on the ultimate data of existence and of the universe struck him as the same metaphysical method that was as young as the youngest race, as old as the cave-man, and older—the same that moved the first Pleistocene ape-man to fear the dark; that moved the first hasty Hebrew savage to incarnate Eve from Adam’s rib; that moved Descartes to build an idealistic system of the universe out of the projections of his own puny ego; and that moved the famous British ecclesiastic to denounce evolution in satire so scathing as to win immediate applause and leave his name a notorious scrawl on the page of history.

So Martin thought, and he thought further, till it dawned upon him that the difference between these lawyers, officers, business men, and bank cashiers he had met and the members of the working class he had known was on a par with the difference in the food they ate, clothes they wore, neighborhoods in which they lived.  Certainly, in all of them was lacking the something more which he found in himself and in the books.  The Morses had shown him the best their social position could produce, and he was not impressed by it.  A pauper himself, a slave to the money-lender, he knew himself the superior of those he met at the Morses’; and, when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn, he moved among them a lord of life, quivering with a sense of outrage akin to what a prince would suffer if condemned to live with goat-herds.

“You hate and fear the socialists,” he remarked to Mr. Morse, one evening at dinner; “but why?  You know neither them nor their doctrines.”

The conversation had been swung in that direction by Mrs. Morse, who had been invidiously singing the praises of Mr. Hapgood.  The cashier was Martin’s black beast, and his temper was a trifle short where the talker of platitudes was concerned.

“Yes,” he had said, “Charley Hapgood is what they call a rising young man—somebody told me as much.  And it is true.  He’ll make the Governor’s Chair before he dies, and, who knows? maybe the United States Senate.”

“What makes you think so?” Mrs. Morse had inquired.

“I’ve heard him make a campaign speech.  It was so cleverly stupid and unoriginal, and also so convincing, that the leaders cannot help but regard him as safe and sure, while his platitudes are so much like the platitudes of the average voter that—oh, well, you know you flatter any man by dressing up his own thoughts for him and presenting them to him.”

“I actually think you are jealous of Mr. Hapgood,” Ruth had chimed in.

“Heaven forbid!”

The look of horror on Martin’s face stirred Mrs. Morse to belligerence.

“You surely don’t mean to say that Mr. Hapgood is stupid?” she demanded icily.

“No more than the average Republican,” was the retort, “or average Democrat, either.  They are all stupid when they are not crafty, and very few of them are crafty.  The only wise Republicans are the millionnaires and their conscious henchmen.  They know which side their bread is buttered on, and they know why.”

“I am a Republican,” Mr. Morse put in lightly.  “Pray, how do you classify me?”

“Oh, you are an unconscious henchman.”

“Henchman?”

“Why, yes.  You do corporation work.  You have no working-class nor criminal practice.  You don’t depend upon wife-beaters and pickpockets for your income.  You get your livelihood from the masters of society, and whoever feeds a man is that man’s master.  Yes, you are a henchman.  You are interested in advancing the interests of the aggregations of capital you serve.”

Mr. Morse’s face was a trifle red.

“I confess, sir,” he said, “that you talk like a scoundrelly socialist.”

Then it was that Martin made his remark:

“You hate and fear the socialists; but why?  You know neither them nor their doctrines.”

“Your doctrine certainly sounds like socialism,” Mr. Morse replied, while Ruth gazed anxiously from one to the other, and Mrs. Morse beamed happily at the opportunity afforded of rousing her liege lord’s antagonism.

“Because I say Republicans are stupid, and hold that liberty, equality, and fraternity are exploded bubbles, does not make me a socialist,” Martin said with a smile.  “Because I question Jefferson and the unscientific Frenchmen who informed his mind, does not make me a socialist.  Believe me, Mr. Morse, you are far nearer socialism than I who am its avowed enemy.”

“Now you please to be facetious,” was all the other could say.

“Not at all.  I speak in all seriousness.  You still believe in equality, and yet you do the work of the corporations, and the corporations, from day to day, are busily engaged in burying equality.  And you call me a socialist because I deny equality, because I affirm just what you live up to.  The Republicans are foes to equality, though most of them fight the battle against equality with the very word itself the slogan on their lips.  In the name of equality they destroy equality.  That was why I called them stupid.  As for myself, I am an individualist.  I believe the race is to the swift, the battle to the strong.  Such is the lesson I have learned from biology, or at least think I have learned.  As I said, I am an individualist, and individualism is the hereditary and eternal foe of socialism.”

“But you frequent socialist meetings,” Mr. Morse challenged.

“Certainly, just as spies frequent hostile camps.  How else are you to learn about the enemy?  Besides, I enjoy myself at their meetings.  They are good fighters, and, right or wrong, they have read the books.  Any one of them knows far more about sociology and all the other ologies than the average captain of industry.  Yes, I have been to half a dozen of their meetings, but that doesn’t make me a socialist any more than hearing Charley Hapgood orate made me a Republican.”

“I can’t help it,” Mr. Morse said feebly, “but I still believe you incline that way.”

Bless me, Martin thought to himself, he doesn’t know what I was talking about.  He hasn’t understood a word of it.  What did he do with his education, anyway?

Thus, in his development, Martin found himself face to face with economic morality, or the morality of class; and soon it became to him a grisly monster.  Personally, he was an intellectual moralist, and more offending to him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those about him, which was a curious hotchpotch of the economic, the metaphysical, the sentimental, and the imitative.

A sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home.  His sister Marian had been keeping company with an industrious young mechanic, of German extraction, who, after thoroughly learning the trade, had set up for himself in a bicycle-repair shop.  Also, having got the agency for a low-grade make of wheel, he was prosperous.  Marian had called on Martin in his room a short time before to announce her engagement, during which visit she had playfully inspected Martin’s palm and told his fortune.  On her next visit she brought Hermann von Schmidt along with her.  Martin did the honors and congratulated both of them in language so easy and graceful as to affect disagreeably the peasant-mind of his sister’s lover.  This bad impression was further heightened by Martin’s reading aloud the half-dozen stanzas of verse with which he had commemorated Marian’s previous visit.  It was a bit of society verse, airy and delicate, which he had named “The Palmist.”  He was surprised, when he finished reading it, to note no enjoyment in his sister’s face.  Instead, her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her betrothed, and Martin, following her gaze, saw spread on that worthy’s asymmetrical features nothing but black and sullen disapproval.  The incident passed over, they made an early departure, and Martin forgot all about it, though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman, even of the working class, should not have been flattered and delighted by having poetry written about her.

Several evenings later Marian again visited him, this time alone.  Nor did she waste time in coming to the point, upbraiding him sorrowfully for what he had done.

“Why, Marian,” he chided, “you talk as though you were ashamed of your relatives, or of your brother at any rate.”

“And I am, too,” she blurted out.

Martin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her eyes.  The mood, whatever it was, was genuine.

“But, Marian, why should your Hermann be jealous of my writing poetry about my own sister?”

“He ain’t jealous,” she sobbed.  “He says it was indecent, ob—obscene.”

Martin emitted a long, low whistle of incredulity, then proceeded to resurrect and read a carbon copy of “The Palmist.”

“I can’t see it,” he said finally, proffering the manuscript to her.  “Read it yourself and show me whatever strikes you as obscene—that was the word, wasn’t it?”

“He says so, and he ought to know,” was the answer, with a wave aside of the manuscript, accompanied by a look of loathing.  “And he says you’ve got to tear it up.  He says he won’t have no wife of his with such things written about her which anybody can read.  He says it’s a disgrace, an’ he won’t stand for it.”

“Now, look here, Marian, this is nothing but nonsense,” Martin began; then abruptly changed his mind.

He saw before him an unhappy girl, knew the futility of attempting to convince her husband or her, and, though the whole situation was absurd and preposterous, he resolved to surrender.

“All right,” he announced, tearing the manuscript into half a dozen pieces and throwing it into the waste-basket.

He contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original type-written manuscript was reposing in the office of a New York magazine.  Marian and her husband would never know, and neither himself nor they nor the world would lose if the pretty, harmless poem ever were published.

Marian, starting to reach into the waste-basket, refrained.

“Can I?” she pleaded.

He nodded his head, regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn pieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her jacket—ocular evidence of the success of her mission.  She reminded him of Lizzie Connolly, though there was less of fire and gorgeous flaunting life in her than in that other girl of the working class whom he had seen twice.  But they were on a par, the pair of them, in dress and carriage, and he smiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his fancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in Mrs. Morse’s drawing-room.  The amusement faded, and he was aware of a great loneliness.  This sister of his and the Morse drawing-room were milestones of the road he had travelled.  And he had left them behind.  He glanced affectionately about him at his few books.  They were all the comrades left to him.

“Hello, what’s that?” he demanded in startled surprise.

Marian repeated her question.

“Why don’t I go to work?”  He broke into a laugh that was only half-hearted.  “That Hermann of yours has been talking to you.”

She shook her head.

“Don’t lie,” he commanded, and the nod of her head affirmed his charge.

“Well, you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business; that when I write poetry about the girl he’s keeping company with it’s his business, but that outside of that he’s got no say so.  Understand?

“So you don’t think I’ll succeed as a writer, eh?” he went on.  “You think I’m no good?—that I’ve fallen down and am a disgrace to the family?”

“I think it would be much better if you got a job,” she said firmly, and he saw she was sincere.  “Hermann says—”

“Damn Hermann!” he broke out good-naturedly.  “What I want to know is when you’re going to get married.  Also, you find out from your Hermann if he will deign to permit you to accept a wedding present from me.”

He mused over the incident after she had gone, and once or twice broke out into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her betrothed, all the members of his own class and the members of Ruth’s class, directing their narrow little lives by narrow little formulas—herd-creatures, flocking together and patterning their lives by one another’s opinions, failing of being individuals and of really living life because of the childlike formulas by which they were enslaved.  He summoned them before him in apparitional procession: Bernard Higginbotham arm in arm with Mr. Butler, Hermann von Schmidt cheek by jowl with Charley Hapgood, and one by one and in pairs he judged them and dismissed them—judged them by the standards of intellect and morality he had learned from the books.  Vainly he asked: Where are the great souls, the great men and women?  He found them not among the careless, gross, and stupid intelligences that answered the call of vision to his narrow room.  He felt a loathing for them such as Circe must have felt for her swine.  When he had dismissed the last one and thought himself alone, a late-comer entered, unexpected and unsummoned.  Martin watched him and saw the stiff-rim, the square-cut, double-breasted coat and the swaggering shoulders, of the youthful hoodlum who had once been he.

“You were like all the rest, young fellow,” Martin sneered.  “Your morality and your knowledge were just the same as theirs.  You did not think and act for yourself.  Your opinions, like your clothes, were ready made; your acts were shaped by popular approval.  You were cock of your gang because others acclaimed you the real thing.  You fought and ruled the gang, not because you liked to,—you know you really despised it,—but because the other fellows patted you on the shoulder.  You licked Cheese-Face because you wouldn’t give in, and you wouldn’t give in partly because you were an abysmal brute and for the rest because you believed what every one about you believed, that the measure of manhood was the carnivorous ferocity displayed in injuring and marring fellow-creatures’ anatomies.  Why, you whelp, you even won other fellows’ girls away from them, not because you wanted the girls, but because in the marrow of those about you, those who set your moral pace, was the instinct of the wild stallion and the bull-seal.  Well, the years have passed, and what do you think about it now?”

As if in reply, the vision underwent a swift metamorphosis.  The stiff-rim and the square-cut vanished, being replaced by milder garments; the toughness went out of the face, the hardness out of the eyes; and, the face, chastened and refined, was irradiated from an inner life of communion with beauty and knowledge.  The apparition was very like his present self, and, as he regarded it, he noted the student-lamp by which it was illuminated, and the book over which it pored.  He glanced at the title and read, “The Science of AEsthetics.”  Next, he entered into the apparition, trimmed the student-lamp, and himself went on reading “The Science of AEsthetics.”

CHAPTER XXX

On a beautiful fall day, a day of similar Indian summer to that which had seen their love declared the year before, Martin read his “Love-cycle” to Ruth.  It was in the afternoon, and, as before, they had ridden out to their favorite knoll in the hills.  Now and again she had interrupted his reading with exclamations of pleasure, and now, as he laid the last sheet of manuscript with its fellows, he waited her judgment.

She delayed to speak, and at last she spoke haltingly, hesitating to frame in words the harshness of her thought.

“I think they are beautiful, very beautiful,” she said; “but you can’t sell them, can you?  You see what I mean,” she said, almost pleaded.  “This writing of yours is not practical.  Something is the matter—maybe it is with the market—that prevents you from earning a living by it.  And please, dear, don’t misunderstand me.  I am flattered, and made proud, and all that—I could not be a true woman were it otherwise—that you should write these poems to me.  But they do not make our marriage possible.  Don’t you see, Martin?  Don’t think me mercenary.  It is love, the thought of our future, with which I am burdened.  A whole year has gone by since we learned we loved each other, and our wedding day is no nearer.  Don’t think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding, for really I have my heart, all that I am, at stake.  Why don’t you try to get work on a newspaper, if you are so bound up in your writing?  Why not become a reporter?—for a while, at least?”

“It would spoil my style,” was his answer, in a low, monotonous voice.  “You have no idea how I’ve worked for style.”

“But those storiettes,” she argued.  “You called them hack-work.  You wrote many of them.  Didn’t they spoil your style?”

“No, the cases are different.  The storiettes were ground out, jaded, at the end of a long day of application to style.  But a reporter’s work is all hack from morning till night, is the one paramount thing of life.  And it is a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past nor future, and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style, and that certainly is not literature.  To become a reporter now, just as my style is taking form, crystallizing, would be to commit literary suicide.  As it is, every storiette, every word of every storiette, was a violation of myself, of my self-respect, of my respect for beauty.  I tell you it was sickening.  I was guilty of sin.  And I was secretly glad when the markets failed, even if my clothes did go into pawn.  But the joy of writing the ‘Love-cycle’!  The creative joy in its noblest form!  That was compensation for everything.”

Martin did not know that Ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative joy.  She used the phrase—it was on her lips he had first heard it.  She had read about it, studied about it, in the university in the course of earning her Bachelorship of Arts; but she was not original, not creative, and all manifestations of culture on her part were but harpings of the harpings of others.

“May not the editor have been right in his revision of your ‘Sea Lyrics’?” she questioned.  “Remember, an editor must have proved qualifications or else he would not be an editor.”

“That’s in line with the persistence of the established,” he rejoined, his heat against the editor-folk getting the better of him.  “What is, is not only right, but is the best possible.  The existence of anything is sufficient vindication of its fitness to exist—to exist, mark you, as the average person unconsciously believes, not merely in present conditions, but in all conditions.  It is their ignorance, of course, that makes them believe such rot—their ignorance, which is nothing more nor less than the henidical mental process described by Weininger.  They think they think, and such thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the lives of the few who really think.”

He paused, overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking over Ruth’s head.

“I’m sure I don’t know who this Weininger is,” she retorted.  “And you are so dreadfully general that I fail to follow you.  What I was speaking of was the qualification of editors—”

“And I’ll tell you,” he interrupted.  “The chief qualification of ninety-nine per cent of all editors is failure.  They have failed as writers.  Don’t think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and the slavery to their circulation and to the business manager to the joy of writing.  They have tried to write, and they have failed.  And right there is the cursed paradox of it.  Every portal to success in literature is guarded by those watch-dogs, the failures in literature.  The editors, sub-editors, associate editors, most of them, and the manuscript-readers for the magazines and book-publishers, most of them, nearly all of them, are men who wanted to write and who have failed.  And yet they, of all creatures under the sun the most unfit, are the very creatures who decide what shall and what shall not find its way into print—they, who have proved themselves not original, who have demonstrated that they lack the divine fire, sit in judgment upon originality and genius.  And after them come the reviewers, just so many more failures.  Don’t tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and attempted to write poetry or fiction; for they have, and they have failed.  Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod-liver oil.  But you know my opinion on the reviewers and the alleged critics.  There are great critics, but they are as rare as comets.  If I fail as a writer, I shall have proved for the career of editorship.  There’s bread and butter and jam, at any rate.”

Ruth’s mind was quick, and her disapproval of her lover’s views was buttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention.

“But, Martin, if that be so, if all the doors are closed as you have shown so conclusively, how is it possible that any of the great writers ever arrived?”

“They arrived by achieving the impossible,” he answered.  “They did such blazing, glorious work as to burn to ashes those that opposed them.  They arrived by course of miracle, by winning a thousand-to-one wager against them.  They arrived because they were Carlyle’s battle-scarred giants who will not be kept down.  And that is what I must do; I must achieve the impossible.”

“But if you fail?  You must consider me as well, Martin.”

“If I fail?”  He regarded her for a moment as though the thought she had uttered was unthinkable.  Then intelligence illumined his eyes.  “If I fail, I shall become an editor, and you will be an editor’s wife.”

She frowned at his facetiousness—a pretty, adorable frown that made him put his arm around her and kiss it away.

“There, that’s enough,” she urged, by an effort of will withdrawing herself from the fascination of his strength.  “I have talked with father and mother.  I never before asserted myself so against them.  I demanded to be heard.  I was very undutiful.  They are against you, you know; but I assured them over and over of my abiding love for you, and at last father agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away in his office.  And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you enough at the start so that we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere.  Which I think was very fine of him—don’t you?”

Martin, with the dull pain of despair at his heart, mechanically reaching for the tobacco and paper (which he no longer carried) to roll a cigarette, muttered something inarticulate, and Ruth went on.

“Frankly, though, and don’t let it hurt you—I tell you, to show you precisely how you stand with him—he doesn’t like your radical views, and he thinks you are lazy.  Of course I know you are not.  I know you work hard.”

How hard, even she did not know, was the thought in Martin’s mind.

“Well, then,” he said, “how about my views?  Do you think they are so radical?”

He held her eyes and waited the answer.

“I think them, well, very disconcerting,” she replied.

The question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the grayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made for him to go to work.  And she, having gone as far as she dared, was willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again.

She had not long to wait.  Martin had a question of his own to propound to her.  He wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him, and within the week each was answered.  Martin precipitated it by reading to her his “The Shame of the Sun.”

“Why don’t you become a reporter?” she asked when he had finished.  “You love writing so, and I am sure you would succeed.  You could rise in journalism and make a name for yourself.  There are a number of great special correspondents.  Their salaries are large, and their field is the world.  They are sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa, like Stanley, or to interview the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.”

“Then you don’t like my essay?” he rejoined.  “You believe that I have some show in journalism but none in literature?”

“No, no; I do like it.  It reads well.  But I am afraid it’s over the heads of your readers.  At least it is over mine.  It sounds beautiful, but I don’t understand it.  Your scientific slang is beyond me.  You are an extremist, you know, dear, and what may be intelligible to you may not be intelligible to the rest of us.”

“I imagine it’s the philosophic slang that bothers you,” was all he could say.

He was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had expressed, and her verdict stunned him.

“No matter how poorly it is done,” he persisted, “don’t you see anything in it?—in the thought of it, I mean?”

She shook her head.

“No, it is so different from anything I have read.  I read Maeterlinck and understand him—”

“His mysticism, you understand that?” Martin flashed out.

“Yes, but this of yours, which is supposed to be an attack upon him, I don’t understand.  Of course, if originality counts—”

He stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by speech.  He became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that she had been speaking for some time.

“After all, your writing has been a toy to you,” she was saying.  “Surely you have played with it long enough.  It is time to take up life seriously—our life, Martin.  Hitherto you have lived solely your own.”

“You want me to go to work?” he asked.

“Yes.  Father has offered—”

“I understand all that,” he broke in; “but what I want to know is whether or not you have lost faith in me?”

She pressed his hand mutely, her eyes dim.

“In your writing, dear,” she admitted in a half-whisper.

“You’ve read lots of my stuff,” he went on brutally.  “What do you think of it?  Is it utterly hopeless?  How does it compare with other men’s work?”

“But they sell theirs, and you—don’t.”

“That doesn’t answer my question.  Do you think that literature is not at all my vocation?”

“Then I will answer.”  She steeled herself to do it.  “I don’t think you were made to write.  Forgive me, dear.  You compel me to say it; and you know I know more about literature than you do.”

“Yes, you are a Bachelor of Arts,” he said meditatively; “and you ought to know.”

“But there is more to be said,” he continued, after a pause painful to both.  “I know what I have in me.  No one knows that so well as I.  I know I shall succeed.  I will not be kept down.  I am afire with what I have to say in verse, and fiction, and essay.  I do not ask you to have faith in that, though.  I do not ask you to have faith in me, nor in my writing.  What I do ask of you is to love me and have faith in love.”

“A year ago I believed for two years.  One of those years is yet to run.  And I do believe, upon my honor and my soul, that before that year is run I shall have succeeded.  You remember what you told me long ago, that I must serve my apprenticeship to writing.  Well, I have served it.  I have crammed it and telescoped it.  With you at the end awaiting me, I have never shirked.  Do you know, I have forgotten what it is to fall peacefully asleep.  A few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep my fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep.  I am awakened always now by an alarm clock.  If I fall asleep early or late, I set the alarm accordingly; and this, and the putting out of the lamp, are my last conscious actions.”

“When I begin to feel drowsy, I change the heavy book I am reading for a lighter one.  And when I doze over that, I beat my head with my knuckles in order to drive sleep away.  Somewhere I read of a man who was afraid to sleep.  Kipling wrote the story.  This man arranged a spur so that when unconsciousness came, his naked body pressed against the iron teeth.  Well, I’ve done the same.  I look at the time, and I resolve that not until midnight, or not until one o’clock, or two o’clock, or three o’clock, shall the spur be removed.  And so it rowels me awake until the appointed time.  That spur has been my bed-mate for months.  I have grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an extravagance.  I sleep four hours now.  I am starved for sleep.  There are times when I am light-headed from want of sleep, times when death, with its rest and sleep, is a positive lure to me, times when I am haunted by Longfellow’s lines:

“‘The sea is still and deep;
All things within its bosom sleep;
A single step and all is o’er,
A plunge, a bubble, and no more.’

“Of course, this is sheer nonsense.  It comes from nervousness, from an overwrought mind.  But the point is: Why have I done this?  For you.  To shorten my apprenticeship.  To compel Success to hasten.  And my apprenticeship is now served.  I know my equipment.  I swear that I learn more each month than the average college man learns in a year.  I know it, I tell you.  But were my need for you to understand not so desperate I should not tell you.  It is not boasting.  I measure the results by the books.  Your brothers, to-day, are ignorant barbarians compared with me and the knowledge I have wrung from the books in the hours they were sleeping.  Long ago I wanted to be famous.  I care very little for fame now.  What I want is you; I am more hungry for you than for food, or clothing, or recognition.  I have a dream of laying my head on your breast and sleeping an aeon or so, and the dream will come true ere another year is gone.”

His power beat against her, wave upon wave; and in the moment his will opposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him.  The strength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering in his impassioned voice, his flashing eyes, and the vigor of life and intellect surging in him.  And in that moment, and for the moment, she was aware of a rift that showed in her certitude—a rift through which she caught sight of the real Martin Eden, splendid and invincible; and as animal-trainers have their moments of doubt, so she, for the instant, seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man.

“And another thing,” he swept on.  “You love me.  But why do you love me?  The thing in me that compels me to write is the very thing that draws your love.  You love me because I am somehow different from the men you have known and might have loved.  I was not made for the desk and counting-house, for petty business squabbling, and legal jangling.  Make me do such things, make me like those other men, doing the work they do, breathing the air they breathe, developing the point of view they have developed, and you have destroyed the difference, destroyed me, destroyed the thing you love.  My desire to write is the most vital thing in me.  Had I been a mere clod, neither would I have desired to write, nor would you have desired me for a husband.”

“But you forget,” she interrupted, the quick surface of her mind glimpsing a parallel.  “There have been eccentric inventors, starving their families while they sought such chimeras as perpetual motion.  Doubtless their wives loved them, and suffered with them and for them, not because of but in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion.”

“True,” was the reply.  “But there have been inventors who were not eccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical things; and sometimes, it is recorded, they succeeded.  Certainly I do not seek any impossibilities—”

“You have called it ‘achieving the impossible,’” she interpolated.

“I spoke figuratively.  I seek to do what men have done before me—to write and to live by my writing.”

Her silence spurred him on.

“To you, then, my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion?” he demanded.

He read her answer in the pressure of her hand on his—the pitying mother-hand for the hurt child.  And to her, just then, he was the hurt child, the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible.

Toward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism of her father and mother.

“But you love me?” he asked.

“I do!  I do!” she cried.

“And I love you, not them, and nothing they do can hurt me.”  Triumph sounded in his voice.  “For I have faith in your love, not fear of their enmity.  All things may go astray in this world, but not love.  Love cannot go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the way.”

CHAPTER XXXI

Martin had encountered his sister Gertrude by chance on Broadway—as it proved, a most propitious yet disconcerting chance.  Waiting on the corner for a car, she had seen him first, and noted the eager, hungry lines of his face and the desperate, worried look of his eyes.  In truth, he was desperate and worried.  He had just come from a fruitless interview with the pawnbroker, from whom he had tried to wring an additional loan on his wheel.  The muddy fall weather having come on, Martin had pledged his wheel some time since and retained his black suit.

“There’s the black suit,” the pawnbroker, who knew his every asset, had answered.  “You needn’t tell me you’ve gone and pledged it with that Jew, Lipka.  Because if you have—”

The man had looked the threat, and Martin hastened to cry:-

“No, no; I’ve got it.  But I want to wear it on a matter of business.”

“All right,” the mollified usurer had replied.  “And I want it on a matter of business before I can let you have any more money.  You don’t think I’m in it for my health?”

“But it’s a forty-dollar wheel, in good condition,” Martin had argued.  “And you’ve only let me have seven dollars on it.  No, not even seven.  Six and a quarter; you took the interest in advance.”

“If you want some more, bring the suit,” had been the reply that sent Martin out of the stuffy little den, so desperate at heart as to reflect it in his face and touch his sister to pity.

Scarcely had they met when the Telegraph Avenue car came along and stopped to take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers.  Mrs. Higginbotham divined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on, that he was not going to follow her.  She turned on the step and looked down upon him.  His haggard face smote her to the heart again.

“Ain’t you comin’?” she asked

The next moment she had descended to his side.

“I’m walking—exercise, you know,” he explained.

“Then I’ll go along for a few blocks,” she announced.  “Mebbe it’ll do me good.  I ain’t ben feelin’ any too spry these last few days.”

Martin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general slovenly appearance, in the unhealthy fat, in the drooping shoulders, the tired face with the sagging lines, and in the heavy fall of her feet, without elasticity—a very caricature of the walk that belongs to a free and happy body.

“You’d better stop here,” he said, though she had already come to a halt at the first corner, “and take the next car.”

“My goodness!—if I ain’t all tired a’ready!” she panted.  “But I’m just as able to walk as you in them soles.  They’re that thin they’ll bu’st long before you git out to North Oakland.”

“I’ve a better pair at home,” was the answer.

“Come out to dinner to-morrow,” she invited irrelevantly.  “Mr. Higginbotham won’t be there.  He’s goin’ to San Leandro on business.”

Martin shook his head, but he had failed to keep back the wolfish, hungry look that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner.

“You haven’t a penny, Mart, and that’s why you’re walkin’.  Exercise!”  She tried to sniff contemptuously, but succeeded in producing only a sniffle.  “Here, lemme see.”

And, fumbling in her satchel, she pressed a five-dollar piece into his hand.  “I guess I forgot your last birthday, Mart,” she mumbled lamely.

Martin’s hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold.  In the same instant he knew he ought not to accept, and found himself struggling in the throes of indecision.  That bit of gold meant food, life, and light in his body and brain, power to go on writing, and—who was to say?—maybe to write something that would bring in many pieces of gold.  Clear on his vision burned the manuscripts of two essays he had just completed.  He saw them under the table on top of the heap of returned manuscripts for which he had no stamps, and he saw their titles, just as he had typed them—“The High Priests of Mystery,” and “The Cradle of Beauty.”  He had never submitted them anywhere.  They were as good as anything he had done in that line.  If only he had stamps for them!  Then the certitude of his ultimate success rose up in him, an able ally of hunger, and with a quick movement he slipped the coin into his pocket.

“I’ll pay you back, Gertrude, a hundred times over,” he gulped out, his throat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift hint of moisture.

“Mark my words!” he cried with abrupt positiveness.  “Before the year is out I’ll put an even hundred of those little yellow-boys into your hand.  I don’t ask you to believe me.  All you have to do is wait and see.”

Nor did she believe.  Her incredulity made her uncomfortable, and failing of other expedient, she said:-

“I know you’re hungry, Mart.  It’s sticking out all over you.  Come in to meals any time.  I’ll send one of the children to tell you when Mr. Higginbotham ain’t to be there.  An’ Mart—”

He waited, though he knew in his secret heart what she was about to say, so visible was her thought process to him.

“Don’t you think it’s about time you got a job?”

“You don’t think I’ll win out?” he asked.

She shook her head.

“Nobody has faith in me, Gertrude, except myself.”  His voice was passionately rebellious.  “I’ve done good work already, plenty of it, and sooner or later it will sell.”

“How do you know it is good?”

“Because—”  He faltered as the whole vast field of literature and the history of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of his attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith.  “Well, because it’s better than ninety-nine per cent of what is published in the magazines.”

“I wish’t you’d listen to reason,” she answered feebly, but with unwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis of what was ailing him.  “I wish’t you’d listen to reason,” she repeated, “an’ come to dinner to-morrow.”

After Martin had helped her on the car, he hurried to the post-office and invested three of the five dollars in stamps; and when, later in the day, on the way to the Morse home, he stopped in at the post-office to weigh a large number of long, bulky envelopes, he affixed to them all the stamps save three of the two-cent denomination.

It proved a momentous night for Martin, for after dinner he met Russ Brissenden.  How he chanced to come there, whose friend he was or what acquaintance brought him, Martin did not know.  Nor had he the curiosity to inquire about him of Ruth.  In short, Brissenden struck Martin as anaemic and feather-brained, and was promptly dismissed from his mind.  An hour later he decided that Brissenden was a boor as well, what of the way he prowled about from one room to another, staring at the pictures or poking his nose into books and magazines he picked up from the table or drew from the shelves.  Though a stranger in the house he finally isolated himself in the midst of the company, huddling into a capacious Morris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume he had drawn from his pocket.  As he read, he abstractedly ran his fingers, with a caressing movement, through his hair.  Martin noticed him no more that evening, except once when he observed him chaffing with great apparent success with several of the young women.

It chanced that when Martin was leaving, he overtook Brissenden already half down the walk to the street.

“Hello, is that you?” Martin said.

The other replied with an ungracious grunt, but swung alongside.  Martin made no further attempt at conversation, and for several blocks unbroken silence lay upon them.

“Pompous old ass!”

The suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled Martin.  He felt amused, and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike for the other.

“What do you go to such a place for?” was abruptly flung at him after another block of silence.

“Why do you?” Martin countered.

“Bless me, I don’t know,” came back.  “At least this is my first indiscretion.  There are twenty-four hours in each day, and I must spend them somehow.  Come and have a drink.”

“All right,” Martin answered.

The next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance.  At home was several hours’ hack-work waiting for him before he went to bed, and after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann waiting for him, to say nothing of Herbert Spencer’s Autobiography, which was as replete for him with romance as any thrilling novel.  Why should he waste any time with this man he did not like? was his thought.  And yet, it was not so much the man nor the drink as was it what was associated with the drink—the bright lights, the mirrors and dazzling array of glasses, the warm and glowing faces and the resonant hum of the voices of men.  That was it, it was the voices of men, optimistic men, men who breathed success and spent their money for drinks like men.  He was lonely, that was what was the matter with him; that was why he had snapped at the invitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook.  Not since with Joe, at Shelly Hot Springs, with the one exception of the wine he took with the Portuguese grocer, had Martin had a drink at a public bar.  Mental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor such as physical exhaustion did, and he had felt no need for it.  But just now he felt desire for the drink, or, rather, for the atmosphere wherein drinks were dispensed and disposed of.  Such a place was the Grotto, where Brissenden and he lounged in capacious leather chairs and drank Scotch and soda.

They talked.  They talked about many things, and now Brissenden and now Martin took turn in ordering Scotch and soda.  Martin, who was extremely strong-headed, marvelled at the other’s capacity for liquor, and ever and anon broke off to marvel at the other’s conversation.  He was not long in assuming that Brissenden knew everything, and in deciding that here was the second intellectual man he had met.  But he noted that Brissenden had what Professor Caldwell lacked—namely, fire, the flashing insight and perception, the flaming uncontrol of genius.  Living language flowed from him.  His thin lips, like the dies of a machine, stamped out phrases that cut and stung; or again, pursing caressingly about the inchoate sound they articulated, the thin lips shaped soft and velvety things, mellow phrases of glow and glory, of haunting beauty, reverberant of the mystery and inscrutableness of life; and yet again the thin lips were like a bugle, from which rang the crash and tumult of cosmic strife, phrases that sounded clear as silver, that were luminous as starry spaces, that epitomized the final word of science and yet said something more—the poet’s word, the transcendental truth, elusive and without words which could express, and which none the less found expression in the subtle and all but ungraspable connotations of common words.  He, by some wonder of vision, saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism, where was no language for narration, and yet, by some golden miracle of speech, investing known words with unknown significances, he conveyed to Martin’s consciousness messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls.

Martin forgot his first impression of dislike.  Here was the best the books had to offer coming true.  Here was an intelligence, a living man for him to look up to.  “I am down in the dirt at your feet,” Martin repeated to himself again and again.

“You’ve studied biology,” he said aloud, in significant allusion.

To his surprise Brissenden shook his head.

“But you are stating truths that are substantiated only by biology,” Martin insisted, and was rewarded by a blank stare.  “Your conclusions are in line with the books which you must have read.”

“I am glad to hear it,” was the answer.  “That my smattering of knowledge should enable me to short-cut my way to truth is most reassuring.  As for myself, I never bother to find out if I am right or not.  It is all valueless anyway.  Man can never know the ultimate verities.”

“You are a disciple of Spencer!” Martin cried triumphantly.

“I haven’t read him since adolescence, and all I read then was his ‘Education.’”

“I wish I could gather knowledge as carelessly,” Martin broke out half an hour later.  He had been closely analyzing Brissenden’s mental equipment.  “You are a sheer dogmatist, and that’s what makes it so marvellous.  You state dogmatically the latest facts which science has been able to establish only by à posteriori reasoning.  You jump at correct conclusions.  You certainly short-cut with a vengeance.  You feel your way with the speed of light, by some hyperrational process, to truth.”

“Yes, that was what used to bother Father Joseph, and Brother Dutton,” Brissenden replied.  “Oh, no,” he added; “I am not anything.  It was a lucky trick of fate that sent me to a Catholic college for my education.  Where did you pick up what you know?”

And while Martin told him, he was busy studying Brissenden, ranging from a long, lean, aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the overcoat on a neighboring chair, its pockets sagged and bulged by the freightage of many books.  Brissenden’s face and long, slender hands were browned by the sun—excessively browned, Martin thought.  This sunburn bothered Martin.  It was patent that Brissenden was no outdoor man.  Then how had he been ravaged by the sun?  Something morbid and significant attached to that sunburn, was Martin’s thought as he returned to a study of the face, narrow, with high cheek-bones and cavernous hollows, and graced with as delicate and fine an aquiline nose as Martin had ever seen.  There was nothing remarkable about the size of the eyes.  They were neither large nor small, while their color was a nondescript brown; but in them smouldered a fire, or, rather, lurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory.  Defiant, indomitable, even harsh to excess, they at the same time aroused pity.  Martin found himself pitying him he knew not why, though he was soon to learn.

“Oh, I’m a lunger,” Brissenden announced, offhand, a little later, having already stated that he came from Arizona.  “I’ve been down there a couple of years living on the climate.”

“Aren’t you afraid to venture it up in this climate?”

“Afraid?”

There was no special emphasis of his repetition of Martin’s word.  But Martin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that there was nothing of which it was afraid.  The eyes had narrowed till they were eagle-like, and Martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle beak with its dilated nostrils, defiant, assertive, aggressive.  Magnificent, was what he commented to himself, his blood thrilling at the sight.  Aloud, he quoted:-

“‘Under the bludgeoning of Chance
My head is bloody but unbowed.’”

“You like Henley,” Brissenden said, his expression changing swiftly to large graciousness and tenderness.  “Of course, I couldn’t have expected anything else of you.  Ah, Henley!  A brave soul.  He stands out among contemporary rhymesters—magazine rhymesters—as a gladiator stands out in the midst of a band of eunuchs.”

“You don’t like the magazines,” Martin softly impeached.

“Do you?” was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle him.

“I—I write, or, rather, try to write, for the magazines,” Martin faltered.

“That’s better,” was the mollified rejoinder.  “You try to write, but you don’t succeed.  I respect and admire your failure.  I know what you write.  I can see it with half an eye, and there’s one ingredient in it that shuts it out of the magazines.  It’s guts, and magazines have no use for that particular commodity.  What they want is wish-wash and slush, and God knows they get it, but not from you.”

“I’m not above hack-work,” Martin contended.

“On the contrary—”  Brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye over Martin’s objective poverty, passing from the well-worn tie and the saw-edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight fray of one cuff, winding up and dwelling upon Martin’s sunken cheeks.  “On the contrary, hack-work is above you, so far above you that you can never hope to rise to it.  Why, man, I could insult you by asking you to have something to eat.”

Martin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood, and Brissenden laughed triumphantly.

“A full man is not insulted by such an invitation,” he concluded.

“You are a devil,” Martin cried irritably.

“Anyway, I didn’t ask you.”

“You didn’t dare.”

“Oh, I don’t know about that.  I invite you now.”

Brissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke, as if with the intention of departing to the restaurant forthwith.

Martin’s fists were tight-clenched, and his blood was drumming in his temples.

“Bosco!  He eats ’em alive!  Eats ’em alive!”  Brissenden exclaimed, imitating the spieler of a locally famous snake-eater.

“I could certainly eat you alive,” Martin said, in turn running insolent eyes over the other’s disease-ravaged frame.

“Only I’m not worthy of it?”

“On the contrary,” Martin considered, “because the incident is not worthy.”  He broke into a laugh, hearty and wholesome.  “I confess you made a fool of me, Brissenden.  That I am hungry and you are aware of it are only ordinary phenomena, and there’s no disgrace.  You see, I laugh at the conventional little moralities of the herd; then you drift by, say a sharp, true word, and immediately I am the slave of the same little moralities.”

“You were insulted,” Brissenden affirmed.

“I certainly was, a moment ago.  The prejudice of early youth, you know.  I learned such things then, and they cheapen what I have since learned.  They are the skeletons in my particular closet.”

“But you’ve got the door shut on them now?”

“I certainly have.”

“Sure?”

“Sure.”

“Then let’s go and get something to eat.”

“I’ll go you,” Martin answered, attempting to pay for the current Scotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing the waiter bullied by Brissenden into putting that change back on the table.

Martin pocketed it with a grimace, and felt for a moment the kindly weight of Brissenden’s hand upon his shoulder.

CHAPTER XXXII

Promptly, the next afternoon, Maria was excited by Martin’s second visitor.  But she did not lose her head this time, for she seated Brissenden in her parlor’s grandeur of respectability.

“Hope you don’t mind my coming?” Brissenden began.

“No, no, not at all,” Martin answered, shaking hands and waving him to the solitary chair, himself taking to the bed.  “But how did you know where I lived?”

“Called up the Morses.  Miss Morse answered the ’phone.  And here I am.”  He tugged at his coat pocket and flung a thin volume on the table.  “There’s a book, by a poet.  Read it and keep it.”  And then, in reply to Martin’s protest: “What have I to do with books?  I had another hemorrhage this morning.  Got any whiskey?  No, of course not.  Wait a minute.”

He was off and away.  Martin watched his long figure go down the outside steps, and, on turning to close the gate, noted with a pang the shoulders, which had once been broad, drawn in now over, the collapsed ruin of the chest.  Martin got two tumblers, and fell to reading the book of verse, Henry Vaughn Marlow’s latest collection.

“No Scotch,” Brissenden announced on his return.  “The beggar sells nothing but American whiskey.  But here’s a quart of it.”

“I’ll send one of the youngsters for lemons, and we’ll make a toddy,” Martin offered.

“I wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow?” he went on, holding up the volume in question.

“Possibly fifty dollars,” came the answer.  “Though he’s lucky if he pulls even on it, or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk bringing it out.”

“Then one can’t make a living out of poetry?”

Martin’s tone and face alike showed his dejection.

“Certainly not.  What fool expects to?  Out of rhyming, yes.  There’s Bruce, and Virginia Spring, and Sedgwick.  They do very nicely.  But poetry—do you know how Vaughn Marlow makes his living?—teaching in a boys’ cramming-joint down in Pennsylvania, and of all private little hells such a billet is the limit.  I wouldn’t trade places with him if he had fifty years of life before him.  And yet his work stands out from the ruck of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots.  And the reviews he gets!  Damn them, all of them, the crass manikins!”

“Too much is written by the men who can’t write about the men who do write,” Martin concurred.  “Why, I was appalled at the quantities of rubbish written about Stevenson and his work.”

“Ghouls and harpies!” Brissenden snapped out with clicking teeth.  “Yes, I know the spawn—complacently pecking at him for his Father Damien letter, analyzing him, weighing him—”

“Measuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos,” Martin broke in.

“Yes, that’s it, a good phrase,—mouthing and besliming the True, and Beautiful, and Good, and finally patting him on the back and saying, ‘Good dog, Fido.’  Faugh!  ‘The little chattering daws of men,’ Richard Realf called them the night he died.”

“Pecking at star-dust,” Martin took up the strain warmly; “at the meteoric flight of the master-men.  I once wrote a squib on them—the critics, or the reviewers, rather.”

“Let’s see it,” Brissenden begged eagerly.

So Martin unearthed a carbon copy of “Star-dust,” and during the reading of it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and forgot to sip his toddy.

“Strikes me you’re a bit of star-dust yourself, flung into a world of cowled gnomes who cannot see,” was his comment at the end of it.  “Of course it was snapped up by the first magazine?”

Martin ran over the pages of his manuscript book.  “It has been refused by twenty-seven of them.”

Brissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh, but broke down in a fit of coughing.

“Say, you needn’t tell me you haven’t tackled poetry,” he gasped.  “Let me see some of it.”

“Don’t read it now,” Martin pleaded.  “I want to talk with you.  I’ll make up a bundle and you can take it home.”

Brissenden departed with the “Love-cycle,” and “The Peri and the Pearl,” returning next day to greet Martin with:-

“I want more.”

Not only did he assure Martin that he was a poet, but Martin learned that Brissenden also was one.  He was swept off his feet by the other’s work, and astounded that no attempt had been made to publish it.

“A plague on all their houses!” was Brissenden’s answer to Martin’s volunteering to market his work for him.  “Love Beauty for its own sake,” was his counsel, “and leave the magazines alone.  Back to your ships and your sea—that’s my advice to you, Martin Eden.  What do you want in these sick and rotten cities of men?  You are cutting your throat every day you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the needs of magazinedom.  What was it you quoted me the other day?—Oh, yes, ‘Man, the latest of the ephemera.’  Well, what do you, the latest of the ephemera, want with fame?  If you got it, it would be poison to you.  You are too simple, too elemental, and too rational, by my faith, to prosper on such pap.  I hope you never do sell a line to the magazines.  Beauty is the only master to serve.  Serve her and damn the multitude!  Success!  What in hell’s success if it isn’t right there in your Stevenson sonnet, which outranks Henley’s ‘Apparition,’ in that ‘Love-cycle,’ in those sea-poems?

“It is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy, but in the doing of it.  You can’t tell me.  I know it.  You know it.  Beauty hurts you.  It is an everlasting pain in you, a wound that does not heal, a knife of flame.  Why should you palter with magazines?  Let beauty be your end.  Why should you mint beauty into gold?  Anyway, you can’t; so there’s no use in my getting excited over it.  You can read the magazines for a thousand years and you won’t find the value of one line of Keats.  Leave fame and coin alone, sign away on a ship to-morrow, and go back to your sea.”

“Not for fame, but for love,” Martin laughed.  “Love seems to have no place in your Cosmos; in mine, Beauty is the handmaiden of Love.”

Brissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly.  “You are so young, Martin boy, so young.  You will flutter high, but your wings are of the finest gauze, dusted with the fairest pigments.  Do not scorch them.  But of course you have scorched them already.  It required some glorified petticoat to account for that ‘Love-cycle,’ and that’s the shame of it.”

“It glorifies love as well as the petticoat,” Martin laughed.

“The philosophy of madness,” was the retort.  “So have I assured myself when wandering in hasheesh dreams.  But beware.  These bourgeois cities will kill you.  Look at that den of traitors where I met you.  Dry rot is no name for it.  One can’t keep his sanity in such an atmosphere.  It’s degrading.  There’s not one of them who is not degrading, man and woman, all of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and artistic impulses of clams—”

He broke off suddenly and regarded Martin.  Then, with a flash of divination, he saw the situation.  The expression on his face turned to wondering horror.

“And you wrote that tremendous ‘Love-cycle’ to her—that pale, shrivelled, female thing!”

The next instant Martin’s right hand had shot to a throttling clutch on his throat, and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled.  But Martin, looking into his eyes, saw no fear there,—naught but a curious and mocking devil.  Martin remembered himself, and flung Brissenden, by the neck, sidelong upon the bed, at the same moment releasing his hold.

Brissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment, then began to chuckle.

“You had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the flame,” he said.

“My nerves are on a hair-trigger these days,” Martin apologized.  “Hope I didn’t hurt you.  Here, let me mix a fresh toddy.”

“Ah, you young Greek!” Brissenden went on.  “I wonder if you take just pride in that body of yours.  You are devilish strong.  You are a young panther, a lion cub.  Well, well, it is you who must pay for that strength.”

“What do you mean?” Martin asked curiously, passing aim a glass.  “Here, down this and be good.”

“Because—” Brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled appreciation of it.  “Because of the women.  They will worry you until you die, as they have already worried you, or else I was born yesterday.  Now there’s no use in your choking me; I’m going to have my say.  This is undoubtedly your calf love; but for Beauty’s sake show better taste next time.  What under heaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie?  Leave them alone.  Pick out some great, wanton flame of a woman, who laughs at life and jeers at death and loves one while she may.  There are such women, and they will love you just as readily as any pusillanimous product of bourgeois sheltered life.”

“Pusillanimous?” Martin protested.

“Just so, pusillanimous; prattling out little moralities that have been prattled into them, and afraid to live life.  They will love you, Martin, but they will love their little moralities more.  What you want is the magnificent abandon of life, the great free souls, the blazing butterflies and not the little gray moths.  Oh, you will grow tired of them, too, of all the female things, if you are unlucky enough to live.  But you won’t live.  You won’t go back to your ships and sea; therefore, you’ll hang around these pest-holes of cities until your bones are rotten, and then you’ll die.”

“You can lecture me, but you can’t make me talk back,” Martin said.  “After all, you have but the wisdom of your temperament, and the wisdom of my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours.”

They disagreed about love, and the magazines, and many things, but they liked each other, and on Martin’s part it was no less than a profound liking.  Day after day they were together, if for no more than the hour Brissenden spent in Martin’s stuffy room.  Brissenden never arrived without his quart of whiskey, and when they dined together down-town, he drank Scotch and soda throughout the meal.  He invariably paid the way for both, and it was through him that Martin learned the refinements of food, drank his first champagne, and made acquaintance with Rhenish wines.

But Brissenden was always an enigma.  With the face of an ascetic, he was, in all the failing blood of him, a frank voluptuary.  He was unafraid to die, bitter and cynical of all the ways of living; and yet, dying, he loved life, to the last atom of it.  He was possessed by a madness to live, to thrill, “to squirm my little space in the cosmic dust whence I came,” as he phrased it once himself.  He had tampered with drugs and done many strange things in quest of new thrills, new sensations.  As he told Martin, he had once gone three days without water, had done so voluntarily, in order to experience the exquisite delight of such a thirst assuaged.  Who or what he was, Martin never learned.  He was a man without a past, whose future was the imminent grave and whose present was a bitter fever of living.

CHAPTER XXXIII

Martin was steadily losing his battle.  Economize as he would, the earnings from hack-work did not balance expenses.  Thanksgiving found him with his black suit in pawn and unable to accept the Morses’ invitation to dinner.  Ruth was not made happy by his reason for not coming, and the corresponding effect on him was one of desperation.  He told her that he would come, after all; that he would go over to San Francisco, to the Transcontinental office, collect the five dollars due him, and with it redeem his suit of clothes.

In the morning he borrowed ten cents from Maria.  He would have borrowed it, by preference, from Brissenden, but that erratic individual had disappeared.  Two weeks had passed since Martin had seen him, and he vainly cudgelled his brains for some cause of offence.  The ten cents carried Martin across the ferry to San Francisco, and as he walked up Market Street he speculated upon his predicament in case he failed to collect the money.  There would then be no way for him to return to Oakland, and he knew no one in San Francisco from whom to borrow another ten cents.

The door to the Transcontinental office was ajar, and Martin, in the act of opening it, was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from within, which exclaimed:- “But that is not the question, Mr. Ford.”  (Ford, Martin knew, from his correspondence, to be the editor’s name.)  “The question is, are you prepared to pay?—cash, and cash down, I mean?  I am not interested in the prospects of the Transcontinental and what you expect to make it next year.  What I want is to be paid for what I do.  And I tell you, right now, the Christmas Transcontinental don’t go to press till I have the money in my hand.  Good day.  When you get the money, come and see me.”

The door jerked open, and the man flung past Martin, with an angry countenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and clenching his fists.  Martin decided not to enter immediately, and lingered in the hallways for a quarter of an hour.  Then he shoved the door open and walked in.  It was a new experience, the first time he had been inside an editorial office.  Cards evidently were not necessary in that office, for the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who wanted to see Mr. Ford.  Returning, the boy beckoned him from halfway across the room and led him to the private office, the editorial sanctum.  Martin’s first impression was of the disorder and cluttered confusion of the room.  Next he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking man, sitting at a roll-top desk, who regarded him curiously.  Martin marvelled at the calm repose of his face.  It was evident that the squabble with the printer had not affected his equanimity.

“I—I am Martin Eden,” Martin began the conversation.  (“And I want my five dollars,” was what he would have liked to say.)

But this was his first editor, and under the circumstances he did not desire to scare him too abruptly.  To his surprise, Mr. Ford leaped into the air with a “You don’t say so!” and the next moment, with both hands, was shaking Martin’s hand effusively.

“Can’t say how glad I am to see you, Mr. Eden.  Often wondered what you were like.”

Here he held Martin off at arm’s length and ran his beaming eyes over Martin’s second-best suit, which was also his worst suit, and which was ragged and past repair, though the trousers showed the careful crease he had put in with Maria’s flat-irons.

“I confess, though, I conceived you to be a much older man than you are.  Your story, you know, showed such breadth, and vigor, such maturity and depth of thought.  A masterpiece, that story—I knew it when I had read the first half-dozen lines.  Let me tell you how I first read it.  But no; first let me introduce you to the staff.”

Still talking, Mr. Ford led him into the general office, where he introduced him to the associate editor, Mr. White, a slender, frail little man whose hand seemed strangely cold, as if he were suffering from a chill, and whose whiskers were sparse and silky.

“And Mr. Ends, Mr. Eden.  Mr. Ends is our business manager, you know.”

Martin found himself shaking hands with a cranky-eyed, bald-headed man, whose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it, for most of it was covered by a snow-white beard, carefully trimmed—by his wife, who did it on Sundays, at which times she also shaved the back of his neck.

The three men surrounded Martin, all talking admiringly and at once, until it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager.

“We often wondered why you didn’t call,” Mr. White was saying.

“I didn’t have the carfare, and I live across the Bay,” Martin answered bluntly, with the idea of showing them his imperative need for the money.

Surely, he thought to himself, my glad rags in themselves are eloquent advertisement of my need.  Time and again, whenever opportunity offered, he hinted about the purpose of his business.  But his admirers’ ears were deaf.  They sang his praises, told him what they had thought of his story at first sight, what they subsequently thought, what their wives and families thought; but not one hint did they breathe of intention to pay him for it.

“Did I tell you how I first read your story?” Mr. Ford said.  “Of course I didn’t.  I was coming west from New York, and when the train stopped at Ogden, the train-boy on the new run brought aboard the current number of the Transcontinental.”

My God! Martin thought; you can travel in a Pullman while I starve for the paltry five dollars you owe me.  A wave of anger rushed over him.  The wrong done him by the Transcontinental loomed colossal, for strong upon him were all the dreary months of vain yearning, of hunger and privation, and his present hunger awoke and gnawed at him, reminding him that he had eaten nothing since the day before, and little enough then.  For the moment he saw red.  These creatures were not even robbers.  They were sneak-thieves.  By lies and broken promises they had tricked him out of his story.  Well, he would show them.  And a great resolve surged into his will to the effect that he would not leave the office until he got his money.  He remembered, if he did not get it, that there was no way for him to go back to Oakland.  He controlled himself with an effort, but not before the wolfish expression of his face had awed and perturbed them.

They became more voluble than ever.  Mr. Ford started anew to tell how he had first read “The Ring of Bells,” and Mr. Ends at the same time was striving to repeat his niece’s appreciation of “The Ring of Bells,” said niece being a school-teacher in Alameda.

“I’ll tell you what I came for,” Martin said finally.  “To be paid for that story all of you like so well.  Five dollars, I believe, is what you promised me would be paid on publication.”

Mr. Ford, with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and happy acquiescence, started to reach for his pocket, then turned suddenly to Mr. Ends, and said that he had left his money home.  That Mr. Ends resented this, was patent; and Martin saw the twitch of his arm as if to protect his trousers pocket.  Martin knew that the money was there.

“I am sorry,” said Mr. Ends, “but I paid the printer not an hour ago, and he took my ready change.  It was careless of me to be so short; but the bill was not yet due, and the printer’s request, as a favor, to make an immediate advance, was quite unexpected.”

Both men looked expectantly at Mr. White, but that gentleman laughed and shrugged his shoulders.  His conscience was clean at any rate.  He had come into the Transcontinental to learn magazine-literature, instead of which he had principally learned finance.  The Transcontinental owed him four months’ salary, and he knew that the printer must be appeased before the associate editor.

“It’s rather absurd, Mr. Eden, to have caught us in this shape,” Mr. Ford preambled airily.  “All carelessness, I assure you.  But I’ll tell you what we’ll do.  We’ll mail you a check the first thing in the morning.  You have Mr. Eden’s address, haven’t you, Mr. Ends?”

Yes, Mr. Ends had the address, and the check would be mailed the first thing in the morning.  Martin’s knowledge of banks and checks was hazy, but he could see no reason why they should not give him the check on this day just as well as on the next.

“Then it is understood, Mr. Eden, that we’ll mail you the check to-morrow?” Mr. Ford said.

“I need the money to-day,” Martin answered stolidly.

“The unfortunate circumstances—if you had chanced here any other day,” Mr. Ford began suavely, only to be interrupted by Mr. Ends, whose cranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper.

“Mr. Ford has already explained the situation,” he said with asperity.  “And so have I.  The check will be mailed—”

“I also have explained,” Martin broke in, “and I have explained that I want the money to-day.”

He had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager’s brusqueness, and upon him he kept an alert eye, for it was in that gentleman’s trousers pocket that he divined the Transcontinental’s ready cash was reposing.

“It is too bad—” Mr. Ford began.

But at that moment, with an impatient movement, Mr. Ends turned as if about to leave the room.  At the same instant Martin sprang for him, clutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that Mr. Ends’ snow-white beard, still maintaining its immaculate trimness, pointed ceilingward at an angle of forty-five degrees.  To the horror of Mr. White and Mr. Ford, they saw their business manager shaken like an Astrakhan rug.

“Dig up, you venerable discourager of rising young talent!” Martin exhorted.  “Dig up, or I’ll shake it out of you, even if it’s all in nickels.”  Then, to the two affrighted onlookers: “Keep away!  If you interfere, somebody’s liable to get hurt.”

Mr. Ends was choking, and it was not until the grip on his throat was eased that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the digging-up programme.  All together, after repeated digs, its trousers pocket yielded four dollars and fifteen cents.

“Inside out with it,” Martin commanded.

An additional ten cents fell out.  Martin counted the result of his raid a second time to make sure.

“You next!” he shouted at Mr. Ford.  “I want seventy-five cents more.”

Mr. Ford did not wait, but ransacked his pockets, with the result of sixty cents.

“Sure that is all?” Martin demanded menacingly, possessing himself of it.  “What have you got in your vest pockets?”

In token of his good faith, Mr. Ford turned two of his pockets inside out.  A strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them.  He recovered it and was in the act of returning it, when Martin cried:-

“What’s that?—A ferry ticket?  Here, give it to me.  It’s worth ten cents.  I’ll credit you with it.  I’ve now got four dollars and ninety-five cents, including the ticket.  Five cents is still due me.”

He looked fiercely at Mr. White, and found that fragile creature in the act of handing him a nickel.

“Thank you,” Martin said, addressing them collectively.  “I wish you a good day.”

“Robber!” Mr. Ends snarled after him.

“Sneak-thief!” Martin retorted, slamming the door as he passed out.

Martin was elated—so elated that when he recollected that The Hornet owed him fifteen dollars for “The Peri and the Pearl,” he decided forthwith to go and collect it.  But The Hornet was run by a set of clean-shaven, strapping young men, frank buccaneers who robbed everything and everybody, not excepting one another.  After some breakage of the office furniture, the editor (an ex-college athlete), ably assisted by the business manager, an advertising agent, and the porter, succeeded in removing Martin from the office and in accelerating, by initial impulse, his descent of the first flight of stairs.

“Come again, Mr. Eden; glad to see you any time,” they laughed down at him from the landing above.

Martin grinned as he picked himself up.

“Phew!” he murmured back.  “The Transcontinental crowd were nanny-goats, but you fellows are a lot of prize-fighters.”

More laughter greeted this.

“I must say, Mr. Eden,” the editor of The Hornet called down, “that for a poet you can go some yourself.  Where did you learn that right cross—if I may ask?”

“Where you learned that half-Nelson,” Martin answered.  “Anyway, you’re going to have a black eye.”

“I hope your neck doesn’t stiffen up,” the editor wished solicitously: “What do you say we all go out and have a drink on it—not the neck, of course, but the little rough-house?”

“I’ll go you if I lose,” Martin accepted.

And robbers and robbed drank together, amicably agreeing that the battle was to the strong, and that the fifteen dollars for “The Peri and the Pearl” belonged by right to The Hornet’s editorial staff.

CHAPTER XXXIV

Arthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria’s front steps.  She heard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when Martin let her in, found him on the last page of a manuscript.  She had come to make certain whether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving dinner; but before she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the one with which he was full.

“Here, let me read you this,” he cried, separating the carbon copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape.  “It’s my latest, and different from anything I’ve done.  It is so altogether different that I am almost afraid of it, and yet I’ve a sneaking idea it is good.  You be judge.  It’s an Hawaiian story.  I’ve called it ‘Wiki-wiki.’”

His face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting.  She listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had seen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:-

“Frankly, what do you think of it?”

“I—I don’t know,” she, answered.  “Will it—do you think it will sell?”

“I’m afraid not,” was the confession.  “It’s too strong for the magazines.  But it’s true, on my word it’s true.”

“But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won’t sell?” she went on inexorably.  “The reason for your writing is to make a living, isn’t it?”

“Yes, that’s right; but the miserable story got away with me.  I couldn’t help writing it.  It demanded to be written.”

“But that character, that Wiki-Wiki, why do you make him talk so roughly?  Surely it will offend your readers, and surely that is why the editors are justified in refusing your work.”

“Because the real Wiki-Wiki would have talked that way.”

“But it is not good taste.”

“It is life,” he replied bluntly.  “It is real.  It is true.  And I must write life as I see it.”

She made no answer, and for an awkward moment they sat silent.  It was because he loved her that he did not quite understand her, and she could not understand him because he was so large that he bulked beyond her horizon.

“Well, I’ve collected from the Transcontinental,” he said in an effort to shift the conversation to a more comfortable subject.  The picture of the bewhiskered trio, as he had last seen them, mulcted of four dollars and ninety cents and a ferry ticket, made him chuckle.

“Then you’ll come!” she cried joyously.  “That was what I came to find out.”

“Come?” he muttered absently.  “Where?”

“Why, to dinner to-morrow.  You know you said you’d recover your suit if you got that money.”

“I forgot all about it,” he said humbly.  “You see, this morning the poundman got Maria’s two cows and the baby calf, and—well, it happened that Maria didn’t have any money, and so I had to recover her cows for her.  That’s where the Transcontinental fiver went—‘The Ring of Bells’ went into the poundman’s pocket.”

“Then you won’t come?”

He looked down at his clothing.

“I can’t.”

Tears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes, but she said nothing.

“Next Thanksgiving you’ll have dinner with me in Delmonico’s,” he said cheerily; “or in London, or Paris, or anywhere you wish.  I know it.”

“I saw in the paper a few days ago,” she announced abruptly, “that there had been several local appointments to the Railway Mail.  You passed first, didn’t you?”

He was compelled to admit that the call had come for him, but that he had declined it.  “I was so sure—I am so sure—of myself,” he concluded.  “A year from now I’ll be earning more than a dozen men in the Railway Mail.  You wait and see.”

“Oh,” was all she said, when he finished.  She stood up, pulling at her gloves.  “I must go, Martin.  Arthur is waiting for me.”

He took her in his arms and kissed her, but she proved a passive sweetheart.  There was no tenseness in her body, her arms did not go around him, and her lips met his without their wonted pressure.

She was angry with him, he concluded, as he returned from the gate.  But why?  It was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled Maria’s cows.  But it was only a stroke of fate.  Nobody could be blamed for it.  Nor did it enter his head that he could have done aught otherwise than what he had done.  Well, yes, he was to blame a little, was his next thought, for having refused the call to the Railway Mail.  And she had not liked “Wiki-Wiki.”

He turned at the head of the steps to meet the letter-carrier on his afternoon round.  The ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed Martin as he took the bundle of long envelopes.  One was not long.  It was short and thin, and outside was printed the address of The New York Outview.  He paused in the act of tearing the envelope open.  It could not be an acceptance.  He had no manuscripts with that publication.  Perhaps—his heart almost stood still at the—wild thought—perhaps they were ordering an article from him; but the next instant he dismissed the surmise as hopelessly impossible.

It was a short, formal letter, signed by the office editor, merely informing him that an anonymous letter which they had received was enclosed, and that he could rest assured the Outview’s staff never under any circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence.

The enclosed letter Martin found to be crudely printed by hand.  It was a hotchpotch of illiterate abuse of Martin, and of assertion that the “so-called Martin Eden” who was selling stories to magazines was no writer at all, and that in reality he was stealing stories from old magazines, typing them, and sending them out as his own.  The envelope was postmarked “San Leandro.”  Martin did not require a second thought to discover the author.  Higginbotham’s grammar, Higginbotham’s colloquialisms, Higginbotham’s mental quirks and processes, were apparent throughout.  Martin saw in every line, not the fine Italian hand, but the coarse grocer’s fist, of his brother-in-law.

But why? he vainly questioned.  What injury had he done Bernard Higginbotham?  The thing was so unreasonable, so wanton.  There was no explaining it.  In the course of the week a dozen similar letters were forwarded to Martin by the editors of various Eastern magazines.  The editors were behaving handsomely, Martin concluded.  He was wholly unknown to them, yet some of them had even been sympathetic.  It was evident that they detested anonymity.  He saw that the malicious attempt to hurt him had failed.  In fact, if anything came of it, it was bound to be good, for at least his name had been called to the attention of a number of editors.  Sometime, perhaps, reading a submitted manuscript of his, they might remember him as the fellow about whom they had received an anonymous letter.  And who was to say that such a remembrance might not sway the balance of their judgment just a trifle in his favor?

It was about this time that Martin took a great slump in Maria’s estimation.  He found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with pain, tears of weakness running down her cheeks, vainly endeavoring to put through a large ironing.  He promptly diagnosed her affliction as La Grippe, dosed her with hot whiskey (the remnants in the bottles for which Brissenden was responsible), and ordered her to bed.  But Maria was refractory.  The ironing had to be done, she protested, and delivered that night, or else there would be no food on the morrow for the seven small and hungry Silvas.

To her astonishment (and it was something that she never ceased from relating to her dying day), she saw Martin Eden seize an iron from the stove and throw a fancy shirt-waist on the ironing-board.  It was Kate Flanagan’s best Sunday waist, than whom there was no more exacting and fastidiously dressed woman in Maria’s world.  Also, Miss Flanagan had sent special instruction that said waist must be delivered by that night.  As every one knew, she was keeping company with John Collins, the blacksmith, and, as Maria knew privily, Miss Flanagan and Mr. Collins were going next day to Golden Gate Park.  Vain was Maria’s attempt to rescue the garment.  Martin guided her tottering footsteps to a chair, from where she watched him with bulging eyes.  In a quarter of the time it would have taken her she saw the shirt-waist safely ironed, and ironed as well as she could have done it, as Martin made her grant.

“I could work faster,” he explained, “if your irons were only hotter.”

To her, the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to use.

“Your sprinkling is all wrong,” he complained next.  “Here, let me teach you how to sprinkle.  Pressure is what’s wanted.  Sprinkle under pressure if you want to iron fast.”

He procured a packing-case from the woodpile in the cellar, fitted a cover to it, and raided the scrap-iron the Silva tribe was collecting for the junkman.  With fresh-sprinkled garments in the box, covered with the board and pressed by the iron, the device was complete and in operation.

“Now you watch me, Maria,” he said, stripping off to his undershirt and gripping an iron that was what he called “really hot.”

“An’ when he feenish da iron’ he washa da wools,” as she described it afterward.  “He say, ‘Maria, you are da greata fool.  I showa you how to washa da wools,’ an’ he shows me, too.  Ten minutes he maka da machine—one barrel, one wheel-hub, two poles, justa like dat.”

Martin had learned the contrivance from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs.  The old wheel-hub, fixed on the end of the upright pole, constituted the plunger.  Making this, in turn, fast to the spring-pole attached to the kitchen rafters, so that the hub played upon the woollens in the barrel, he was able, with one hand, thoroughly to pound them.

“No more Maria washa da wools,” her story always ended.  “I maka da kids worka da pole an’ da hub an’ da barrel.  Him da smarta man, Mister Eden.”

Nevertheless, by his masterly operation and improvement of her kitchen-laundry he fell an immense distance in her regard.  The glamour of romance with which her imagination had invested him faded away in the cold light of fact that he was an ex-laundryman.  All his books, and his grand friends who visited him in carriages or with countless bottles of whiskey, went for naught.  He was, after all, a mere workingman, a member of her own class and caste.  He was more human and approachable, but, he was no longer mystery.

Martin’s alienation from his family continued.  Following upon Mr. Higginbotham’s unprovoked attack, Mr. Hermann von Schmidt showed his hand.  The fortunate sale of several storiettes, some humorous verse, and a few jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity.  Not only did he partially pay up his bills, but he had sufficient balance left to redeem his black suit and wheel.  The latter, by virtue of a twisted crank-hanger, required repairing, and, as a matter of friendliness with his future brother-in-law, he sent it to Von Schmidt’s shop.

The afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being delivered by a small boy.  Von Schmidt was also inclined to be friendly, was Martin’s conclusion from this unusual favor.  Repaired wheels usually had to be called for.  But when he examined the wheel, he discovered no repairs had been made.  A little later in the day he telephoned his sister’s betrothed, and learned that that person didn’t want anything to do with him in “any shape, manner, or form.”

“Hermann von Schmidt,” Martin answered cheerfully, “I’ve a good mind to come over and punch that Dutch nose of yours.”

“You come to my shop,” came the reply, “an’ I’ll send for the police.  An’ I’ll put you through, too.  Oh, I know you, but you can’t make no rough-house with me.  I don’t want nothin’ to do with the likes of you.  You’re a loafer, that’s what, an’ I ain’t asleep.  You ain’t goin’ to do no spongin’ off me just because I’m marryin’ your sister.  Why don’t you go to work an’ earn an honest livin’, eh?  Answer me that.”

Martin’s philosophy asserted itself, dissipating his anger, and he hung up the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement.  But after the amusement came the reaction, and he was oppressed by his loneliness.  Nobody understood him, nobody seemed to have any use for him, except Brissenden, and Brissenden had disappeared, God alone knew where.

Twilight was falling as Martin left the fruit store and turned homeward, his marketing on his arm.  At the corner an electric car had stopped, and at sight of a lean, familiar figure alighting, his heart leapt with joy.  It was Brissenden, and in the fleeting glimpse, ere the car started up, Martin noted the overcoat pockets, one bulging with books, the other bulging with a quart bottle of whiskey.

CHAPTER XXXV

Brissenden gave no explanation of his long absence, nor did Martin pry into it.  He was content to see his friend’s cadaverous face opposite him through the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy.

“I, too, have not been idle,” Brissenden proclaimed, after hearing Martin’s account of the work he had accomplished.

He pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it to Martin, who looked at the title and glanced up curiously.

“Yes, that’s it,” Brissenden laughed.  “Pretty good title, eh?  ‘Ephemera’—it is the one word.  And you’re responsible for it, what of your man, who is always the erected, the vitalized inorganic, the latest of the ephemera, the creature of temperature strutting his little space on the thermometer.  It got into my head and I had to write it to get rid of it.  Tell me what you think of it.”

Martin’s face, flushed at first, paled as he read on.  It was perfect art.  Form triumphed over substance, if triumph it could be called where the last conceivable atom of substance had found expression in so perfect construction as to make Martin’s head swim with delight, to put passionate tears into his eyes, and to send chills creeping up and down his back.  It was a long poem of six or seven hundred lines, and it was a fantastic, amazing, unearthly thing.  It was terrific, impossible; and yet there it was, scrawled in black ink across the sheets of paper.  It dealt with man and his soul-gropings in their ultimate terms, plumbing the abysses of space for the testimony of remotest suns and rainbow spectrums.  It was a mad orgy of imagination, wassailing in the skull of a dying man who half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the wild flutter of fading heart-beats.  The poem swung in majestic rhythm to the cool tumult of interstellar conflict, to the onset of starry hosts, to the impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebular in the darkened void; and through it all, unceasing and faint, like a silver shuttle, ran the frail, piping voice of man, a querulous chirp amid the screaming of planets and the crash of systems.

“There is nothing like it in literature,” Martin said, when at last he was able to speak.  “It’s wonderful!—wonderful!  It has gone to my head.  I am drunken with it.  That great, infinitesimal question—I can’t shake it out of my thoughts.  That questing, eternal, ever recurring, thin little wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears.  It is like the dead-march of a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring of lions.  It is insatiable with microscopic desire.  I now I’m making a fool of myself, but the thing has obsessed me.  You are—I don’t know what you are—you are wonderful, that’s all.  But how do you do it?  How do you do it?”

Martin paused from his rhapsody, only to break out afresh.

“I shall never write again.  I am a dauber in clay.  You have shown me the work of the real artificer-artisan.  Genius!  This is something more than genius.  It transcends genius.  It is truth gone mad.  It is true, man, every line of it.  I wonder if you realize that, you dogmatist.  Science cannot give you the lie.  It is the truth of the sneer, stamped out from the black iron of the Cosmos and interwoven with mighty rhythms of sound into a fabric of splendor and beauty.  And now I won’t say another word.  I am overwhelmed, crushed.  Yes, I will, too.  Let me market it for you.”

Brissenden grinned.  “There’s not a magazine in Christendom that would dare to publish it—you know that.”

“I know nothing of the sort.  I know there’s not a magazine in Christendom that wouldn’t jump at it.  They don’t get things like that every day.  That’s no mere poem of the year.  It’s the poem of the century.”

“I’d like to take you up on the proposition.”

“Now don’t get cynical,” Martin exhorted.  “The magazine editors are not wholly fatuous.  I know that.  And I’ll close with you on the bet.  I’ll wager anything you want that ‘Ephemera’ is accepted either on the first or second offering.”

“There’s just one thing that prevents me from taking you.”  Brissenden waited a moment.  “The thing is big—the biggest I’ve ever done.  I know that.  It’s my swan song.  I am almighty proud of it.  I worship it.  It’s better than whiskey.  It is what I dreamed of—the great and perfect thing—when I was a simple young man, with sweet illusions and clean ideals.  And I’ve got it, now, in my last grasp, and I’ll not have it pawed over and soiled by a lot of swine.  No, I won’t take the bet.  It’s mine.  I made it, and I’ve shared it with you.”

“But think of the rest of the world,” Martin protested.  “The function of beauty is joy-making.”

“It’s my beauty.”

“Don’t be selfish.”

“I’m not selfish.”  Brissenden grinned soberly in the way he had when pleased by the thing his thin lips were about to shape.  “I’m as unselfish as a famished hog.”

In vain Martin strove to shake him from his decision.  Martin told him that his hatred of the magazines was rabid, fanatical, and that his conduct was a thousand times more despicable than that of the youth who burned the temple of Diana at Ephesus.  Under the storm of denunciation Brissenden complacently sipped his toddy and affirmed that everything the other said was quite true, with the exception of the magazine editors.  His hatred of them knew no bounds, and he excelled Martin in denunciation when he turned upon them.

“I wish you’d type it for me,” he said.  “You know how a thousand times better than any stenographer.  And now I want to give you some advice.”  He drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket.  “Here’s your ‘Shame of the Sun.’  I’ve read it not once, but twice and three times—the highest compliment I can pay you.  After what you’ve said about ‘Ephemera’ I must be silent.  But this I will say: when ‘The Shame of the Sun’ is published, it will make a hit.  It will start a controversy that will be worth thousands to you just in advertising.”

Martin laughed.  “I suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the magazines.”

“By all means no—that is, if you want to see it in print.  Offer it to the first-class houses.  Some publisher’s reader may be mad enough or drunk enough to report favorably on it.  You’ve read the books.  The meat of them has been transmuted in the alembic of Martin Eden’s mind and poured into ‘The Shame of the Sun,’ and one day Martin Eden will be famous, and not the least of his fame will rest upon that work.  So you must get a publisher for it—the sooner the better.”

Brissenden went home late that night; and just as he mounted the first step of the car, he swung suddenly back on Martin and thrust into his hand a small, tightly crumpled wad of paper.

“Here, take this,” he said.  “I was out to the races to-day, and I had the right dope.”

The bell clanged and the car pulled out, leaving Martin wondering as to the nature of the crinkly, greasy wad he clutched in his hand.  Back in his room he unrolled it and found a hundred-dollar bill.

He did not scruple to use it.  He knew his friend had always plenty of money, and he knew also, with profound certitude, that his success would enable him to repay it.  In the morning he paid every bill, gave Maria three months’ advance on the room, and redeemed every pledge at the pawnshop.  Next he bought Marian’s wedding present, and simpler presents, suitable to Christmas, for Ruth and Gertrude.  And finally, on the balance remaining to him, he herded the whole Silva tribe down into Oakland.  He was a winter late in redeeming his promise, but redeemed it was, for the last, least Silva got a pair of shoes, as well as Maria herself.  Also, there were horns, and dolls, and toys of various sorts, and parcels and bundles of candies and nuts that filled the arms of all the Silvas to overflowing.

It was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and Maria’s heels into a confectioner’s in quest if the biggest candy-cane ever made, that he encountered Ruth and her mother.  Mrs. Morse was shocked.  Even Ruth was hurt, for she had some regard for appearances, and her lover, cheek by jowl with Maria, at the head of that army of Portuguese ragamuffins, was not a pretty sight.  But it was not that which hurt so much as what she took to be his lack of pride and self-respect.  Further, and keenest of all, she read into the incident the impossibility of his living down his working-class origin.  There was stigma enough in the fact of it, but shamelessly to flaunt it in the face of the world—her world—was going too far.  Though her engagement to Martin had been kept secret, their long intimacy had not been unproductive of gossip; and in the shop, glancing covertly at her lover and his following, had been several of her acquaintances.  She lacked the easy largeness of Martin and could not rise superior to her environment.  She had been hurt to the quick, and her sensitive nature was quivering with the shame of it.  So it was, when Martin arrived later in the day, that he kept her present in his breast-pocket, deferring the giving of it to a more propitious occasion.  Ruth in tears—passionate, angry tears—was a revelation to him.  The spectacle of her suffering convinced him that he had been a brute, yet in the soul of him he could not see how nor why.  It never entered his head to be ashamed of those he knew, and to take the Silvas out to a Christmas treat could in no way, so it seemed to him, show lack of consideration for Ruth.  On the other hand, he did see Ruth’s point of view, after she had explained it; and he looked upon it as a feminine weakness, such as afflicted all women and the best of women.

CHAPTER XXXVI

“Come on,—I’ll show you the real dirt,” Brissenden said to him, one evening in January.

They had dined together in San Francisco, and were at the Ferry Building, returning to Oakland, when the whim came to him to show Martin the “real dirt.”  He turned and fled across the water-front, a meagre shadow in a flapping overcoat, with Martin straining to keep up with him.  At a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns of old port, and with one in each hand boarded a Mission Street car, Martin at his heels burdened with several quart-bottles of whiskey.

If Ruth could see me now, was his thought, while he wondered as to what constituted the real dirt.

“Maybe nobody will be there,” Brissenden said, when they dismounted and plunged off to the right into the heart of the working-class ghetto, south of Market Street.  “In which case you’ll miss what you’ve been looking for so long.”

“And what the deuce is that?” Martin asked.

“Men, intelligent men, and not the gibbering nonentities I found you consorting with in that trader’s den.  You read the books and you found yourself all alone.  Well, I’m going to show you to-night some other men who’ve read the books, so that you won’t be lonely any more.”

“Not that I bother my head about their everlasting discussions,” he said at the end of a block.  “I’m not interested in book philosophy.  But you’ll find these fellows intelligences and not bourgeois swine.  But watch out, they’ll talk an arm off of you on any subject under the sun.”

“Hope Norton’s there,” he panted a little later, resisting Martin’s effort to relieve him of the two demijohns.  “Norton’s an idealist—a Harvard man.  Prodigious memory.  Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.  Father’s a railroad president and many times millionnaire, but the son’s starving in ’Frisco, editing an anarchist sheet for twenty-five a month.”

Martin was little acquainted in San Francisco, and not at all south of Market; so he had no idea of where he was being led.

“Go ahead,” he said; “tell me about them beforehand.  What do they do for a living?  How do they happen to be here?”

“Hope Hamilton’s there.”  Brissenden paused and rested his hands.  “Strawn-Hamilton’s his name—hyphenated, you know—comes of old Southern stock.  He’s a tramp—laziest man I ever knew, though he’s clerking, or trying to, in a socialist coöperative store for six dollars a week.  But he’s a confirmed hobo.  Tramped into town.  I’ve seen him sit all day on a bench and never a bite pass his lips, and in the evening, when I invited him to dinner—restaurant two blocks away—have him say, ‘Too much trouble, old man.  Buy me a package of cigarettes instead.’  He was a Spencerian like you till Kreis turned him to materialistic monism.  I’ll start him on monism if I can.  Norton’s another monist—only he affirms naught but spirit.  He can give Kreis and Hamilton all they want, too.”

“Who is Kreis?” Martin asked.

“His rooms we’re going to.  One time professor—fired from university—usual story.  A mind like a steel trap.  Makes his living any old way.  I know he’s been a street fakir when he was down.  Unscrupulous.  Rob a corpse of a shroud—anything.  Difference between him—and the bourgeoisie is that he robs without illusion.  He’ll talk Nietzsche, or Schopenhauer, or Kant, or anything, but the only thing in this world, not excepting Mary, that he really cares for, is his monism.  Haeckel is his little tin god.  The only way to insult him is to take a slap at Haeckel.”

“Here’s the hang-out.”  Brissenden rested his demijohn at the upstairs entrance, preliminary to the climb.  It was the usual two-story corner building, with a saloon and grocery underneath.  “The gang lives here—got the whole upstairs to themselves.  But Kreis is the only one who has two rooms.  Come on.”

No lights burned in the upper hall, but Brissenden threaded the utter blackness like a familiar ghost.  He stopped to speak to Martin.

“There’s one fellow—Stevens—a theosophist.  Makes a pretty tangle when he gets going.  Just now he’s dish-washer in a restaurant.  Likes a good cigar.  I’ve seen him eat in a ten-cent hash-house and pay fifty cents for the cigar he smoked afterward.  I’ve got a couple in my pocket for him, if he shows up.”

“And there’s another fellow—Parry—an Australian, a statistician and a sporting encyclopaedia.  Ask him the grain output of Paraguay for 1903, or the English importation of sheetings into China for 1890, or at what weight Jimmy Britt fought Battling Nelson, or who was welter-weight champion of the United States in ’68, and you’ll get the correct answer with the automatic celerity of a slot-machine.  And there’s Andy, a stone-mason, has ideas on everything, a good chess-player; and another fellow, Harry, a baker, red hot socialist and strong union man.  By the way, you remember Cooks’ and Waiters’ strike—Hamilton was the chap who organized that union and precipitated the strike—planned it all out in advance, right here in Kreis’s rooms.  Did it just for the fun of it, but was too lazy to stay by the union.  Yet he could have risen high if he wanted to.  There’s no end to the possibilities in that man—if he weren’t so insuperably lazy.”

Brissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked the threshold of a door.  A knock and an answer opened it, and Martin found himself shaking hands with Kreis, a handsome brunette man, with dazzling white teeth, a drooping black mustache, and large, flashing black eyes.  Mary, a matronly young blonde, was washing dishes in the little back room that served for kitchen and dining room.  The front room served as bedchamber and living room.  Overhead was the week’s washing, hanging in festoons so low that Martin did not see at first the two men talking in a corner.  They hailed Brissenden and his demijohns with acclamation, and, on being introduced, Martin learned they were Andy and Parry.  He joined them and listened attentively to the description of a prize-fight Parry had seen the night before; while Brissenden, in his glory, plunged into the manufacture of a toddy and the serving of wine and whiskey-and-sodas.  At his command, “Bring in the clan,” Andy departed to go the round of the rooms for the lodgers.

“We’re lucky that most of them are here,” Brissenden whispered to Martin.  “There’s Norton and Hamilton; come on and meet them.  Stevens isn’t around, I hear.  I’m going to get them started on monism if I can.  Wait till they get a few jolts in them and they’ll warm up.”

At first the conversation was desultory.  Nevertheless Martin could not fail to appreciate the keen play of their minds.  They were men with opinions, though the opinions often clashed, and, though they were witty and clever, they were not superficial.  He swiftly saw, no matter upon what they talked, that each man applied the correlation of knowledge and had also a deep-seated and unified conception of society and the Cosmos.  Nobody manufactured their opinions for them; they were all rebels of one variety or another, and their lips were strangers to platitudes.  Never had Martin, at the Morses’, heard so amazing a range of topics discussed.  There seemed no limit save time to the things they were alive to.  The talk wandered from Mrs. Humphry Ward’s new book to Shaw’s latest play, through the future of the drama to reminiscences of Mansfield.  They appreciated or sneered at the morning editorials, jumped from labor conditions in New Zealand to Henry James and Brander Matthews, passed on to the German designs in the Far East and the economic aspect of the Yellow Peril, wrangled over the German elections and Bebel’s last speech, and settled down to local politics, the latest plans and scandals in the union labor party administration, and the wires that were pulled to bring about the Coast Seamen’s strike.  Martin was struck by the inside knowledge they possessed.  They knew what was never printed in the newspapers—the wires and strings and the hidden hands that made the puppets dance.  To Martin’s surprise, the girl, Mary, joined in the conversation, displaying an intelligence he had never encountered in the few women he had met.  They talked together on Swinburne and Rossetti, after which she led him beyond his depth into the by-paths of French literature.  His revenge came when she defended Maeterlinck and he brought into action the carefully-thought-out thesis of “The Shame of the Sun.”

Several other men had dropped in, and the air was thick with tobacco smoke, when Brissenden waved the red flag.

“Here’s fresh meat for your axe, Kreis,” he said; “a rose-white youth with the ardor of a lover for Herbert Spencer.  Make a Haeckelite of him—if you can.”

Kreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic, magnetic thing, while Norton looked at Martin sympathetically, with a sweet, girlish smile, as much as to say that he would be amply protected.

Kreis began directly on Martin, but step by step Norton interfered, until he and Kreis were off and away in a personal battle.  Martin listened and fain would have rubbed his eyes.  It was impossible that this should be, much less in the labor ghetto south of Market.  The books were alive in these men.  They talked with fire and enthusiasm, the intellectual stimulant stirring them as he had seen drink and anger stir other men.  What he heard was no longer the philosophy of the dry, printed word, written by half-mythical demigods like Kant and Spencer.  It was living philosophy, with warm, red blood, incarnated in these two men till its very features worked with excitement.  Now and again other men joined in, and all followed the discussion with cigarettes going out in their hands and with alert, intent faces.

Idealism had never attracted Martin, but the exposition it now received at the hands of Norton was a revelation.  The logical plausibility of it, that made an appeal to his intellect, seemed missed by Kreis and Hamilton, who sneered at Norton as a metaphysician, and who, in turn, sneered back at them as metaphysicians.  Phenomenon and noumenon were bandied back and forth.  They charged him with attempting to explain consciousness by itself.  He charged them with word-jugglery, with reasoning from words to theory instead of from facts to theory.  At this they were aghast.  It was the cardinal tenet of their mode of reasoning to start with facts and to give names to the facts.

When Norton wandered into the intricacies of Kant, Kreis reminded him that all good little German philosophies when they died went to Oxford.  A little later Norton reminded them of Hamilton’s Law of Parsimony, the application of which they immediately claimed for every reasoning process of theirs.  And Martin hugged his knees and exulted in it all.  But Norton was no Spencerian, and he, too, strove for Martin’s philosophic soul, talking as much at him as to his two opponents.

“You know Berkeley has never been answered,” he said, looking directly at Martin.  “Herbert Spencer came the nearest, which was not very near.  Even the stanchest of Spencer’s followers will not go farther.  I was reading an essay of Saleeby’s the other day, and the best Saleeby could say was that Herbert Spencer nearly succeeded in answering Berkeley.”

“You know what Hume said?” Hamilton asked.  Norton nodded, but Hamilton gave it for the benefit of the rest.  “He said that Berkeley’s arguments admit of no answer and produce no conviction.”

“In his, Hume’s, mind,” was the reply.  “And Hume’s mind was the same as yours, with this difference: he was wise enough to admit there was no answering Berkeley.”

Norton was sensitive and excitable, though he never lost his head, while Kreis and Hamilton were like a pair of cold-blooded savages, seeking out tender places to prod and poke.  As the evening grew late, Norton, smarting under the repeated charges of being a metaphysician, clutching his chair to keep from jumping to his feet, his gray eyes snapping and his girlish face grown harsh and sure, made a grand attack upon their position.

“All right, you Haeckelites, I may reason like a medicine man, but, pray, how do you reason?  You have nothing to stand on, you unscientific dogmatists with your positive science which you are always lugging about into places it has no right to be.  Long before the school of materialistic monism arose, the ground was removed so that there could be no foundation.  Locke was the man, John Locke.  Two hundred years ago—more than that, even in his ‘Essay concerning the Human Understanding,’ he proved the non-existence of innate ideas.  The best of it is that that is precisely what you claim.  To-night, again and again, you have asserted the non-existence of innate ideas.

“And what does that mean?  It means that you can never know ultimate reality.  Your brains are empty when you are born.  Appearances, or phenomena, are all the content your minds can receive from your five senses.  Then noumena, which are not in your minds when you are born, have no way of getting in—”

“I deny—” Kreis started to interrupt.

“You wait till I’m done,” Norton shouted.  “You can know only that much of the play and interplay of force and matter as impinges in one way or another on our senses.  You see, I am willing to admit, for the sake of the argument, that matter exists; and what I am about to do is to efface you by your own argument.  I can’t do it any other way, for you are both congenitally unable to understand a philosophic abstraction.”

“And now, what do you know of matter, according to your own positive science?  You know it only by its phenomena, its appearances.  You are aware only of its changes, or of such changes in it as cause changes in your consciousness.  Positive science deals only with phenomena, yet you are foolish enough to strive to be ontologists and to deal with noumena.  Yet, by the very definition of positive science, science is concerned only with appearances.  As somebody has said, phenomenal knowledge cannot transcend phenomena.”

“You cannot answer Berkeley, even if you have annihilated Kant, and yet, perforce, you assume that Berkeley is wrong when you affirm that science proves the non-existence of God, or, as much to the point, the existence of matter.—You know I granted the reality of matter only in order to make myself intelligible to your understanding.  Be positive scientists, if you please; but ontology has no place in positive science, so leave it alone.  Spencer is right in his agnosticism, but if Spencer—”

But it was time to catch the last ferry-boat for Oakland, and Brissenden and Martin slipped out, leaving Norton still talking and Kreis and Hamilton waiting to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as soon as he finished.

“You have given me a glimpse of fairyland,” Martin said on the ferry-boat.  “It makes life worth while to meet people like that.  My mind is all worked up.  I never appreciated idealism before.  Yet I can’t accept it.  I know that I shall always be a realist.  I am so made, I guess.  But I’d like to have made a reply to Kreis and Hamilton, and I think I’d have had a word or two for Norton.  I didn’t see that Spencer was damaged any.  I’m as excited as a child on its first visit to the circus.  I see I must read up some more.  I’m going to get hold of Saleeby.  I still think Spencer is unassailable, and next time I’m going to take a hand myself.”

But Brissenden, breathing painfully, had dropped off to sleep, his chin buried in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest, his body wrapped in the long overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers.

CHAPTER XXXVII

The first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to Brissenden’s advice and command.  “The Shame of the Sun” he wrapped and mailed to The Acropolis.  He believed he could find magazine publication for it, and he felt that recognition by the magazines would commend him to the book-publishing houses.  “Ephemera” he likewise wrapped and mailed to a magazine.  Despite Brissenden’s prejudice against the magazines, which was a pronounced mania with him, Martin decided that the great poem should see print.  He did not intend, however, to publish it without the other’s permission.  His plan was to get it accepted by one of the high magazines, and, thus armed, again to wrestle with Brissenden for consent.

Martin began, that morning, a story which he had sketched out a number of weeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its insistent clamor to be created.  Apparently it was to be a rattling sea story, a tale of twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling real characters, in a real world, under real conditions.  But beneath the swing and go of the story was to be something else—something that the superficial reader would never discern and which, on the other hand, would not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a reader.  It was this, and not the mere story, that impelled Martin to write it.  For that matter, it was always the great, universal motif that suggested plots to him.  After having found such a motif, he cast about for the particular persons and particular location in time and space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing.  “Overdue” was the title he had decided for it, and its length he believed would not be more than sixty thousand words—a bagatelle for him with his splendid vigor of production.  On this first day he took hold of it with conscious delight in the mastery of his tools.  He no longer worried for fear that the sharp, cutting edges should slip and mar his work.  The long months of intense application and study had brought their reward.  He could now devote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the thing he shaped; and as he worked, hour after hour, he felt, as never before, the sure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the affairs of life.  “Overdue” would tell a story that would be true of its particular characters and its particular events; but it would tell, too, he was confident, great vital things that would be true of all time, and all sea, and all life—thanks to Herbert Spencer, he thought, leaning back for a moment from the table.  Ay, thanks to Herbert Spencer and to the master-key of life, evolution, which Spencer had placed in his hands.

He was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing.  “It will go!  It will go!” was the refrain that kept, sounding in his ears.  Of course it would go.  At last he was turning out the thing at which the magazines would jump.  The whole story worked out before him in lightning flashes.  He broke off from it long enough to write a paragraph in his note-book.  This would be the last paragraph in “Overdue”; but so thoroughly was the whole book already composed in his brain that he could write, weeks before he had arrived at the end, the end itself.  He compared the tale, as yet unwritten, with the tales of the sea-writers, and he felt it to be immeasurably superior.  “There’s only one man who could touch it,” he murmured aloud, “and that’s Conrad.  And it ought to make even him sit up and shake hands with me, and say, ‘Well done, Martin, my boy.’”

He toiled on all day, recollecting, at the last moment, that he was to have dinner at the Morses’.  Thanks to Brissenden, his black suit was out of pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties.  Down town he stopped off long enough to run into the library and search for Saleeby’s books.  He drew out “The Cycle of Life,” and on the car turned to the essay Norton had mentioned on Spencer.  As Martin read, he grew angry.  His face flushed, his jaw set, and unconsciously his hand clenched, unclenched, and clenched again as if he were taking fresh grips upon some hateful thing out of which he was squeezing the life.  When he left the car, he strode along the sidewalk as a wrathful man will stride, and he rang the Morse bell with such viciousness that it roused him to consciousness of his condition, so that he entered in good nature, smiling with amusement at himself.  No sooner, however, was he inside than a great depression descended upon him.  He fell from the height where he had been up-borne all day on the wings of inspiration.  “Bourgeois,” “trader’s den”—Brissenden’s epithets repeated themselves in his mind.  But what of that? he demanded angrily.  He was marrying Ruth, not her family.

It seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful, more spiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy.  There was color in her cheeks, and her eyes drew him again and again—the eyes in which he had first read immortality.  He had forgotten immortality of late, and the trend of his scientific reading had been away from it; but here, in Ruth’s eyes, he read an argument without words that transcended all worded arguments.  He saw that in her eyes before which all discussion fled away, for he saw love there.  And in his own eyes was love; and love was unanswerable.  Such was his passionate doctrine.

The half hour he had with her, before they went in to dinner, left him supremely happy and supremely satisfied with life.  Nevertheless, at table, the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard day seized hold of him.  He was aware that his eyes were tired and that he was irritable.  He remembered it was at this table, at which he now sneered and was so often bored, that he had first eaten with civilized beings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high culture and refinement.  He caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure of him, so long ago, a self-conscious savage, sprouting sweat at every pore in an agony of apprehension, puzzled by the bewildering minutiae of eating-implements, tortured by the ogre of a servant, striving at a leap to live at such dizzy social altitude, and deciding in the end to be frankly himself, pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not possess.

He glanced at Ruth for reassurance, much in the same manner that a passenger, with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck, will strive to locate the life preservers.  Well, that much had come out of it—love and Ruth.  All the rest had failed to stand the test of the books.  But Ruth and love had stood the test; for them he found a biological sanction.  Love was the most exalted expression of life.  Nature had been busy designing him, as she had been busy with all normal men, for the purpose of loving.  She had spent ten thousand centuries—ay, a hundred thousand and a million centuries—upon the task, and he was the best she could do.  She had made love the strongest thing in him, increased its power a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination, and sent him forth into the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate.  His hand sought Ruth’s hand beside him hidden by the table, and a warm pressure was given and received.  She looked at him a swift instant, and her eyes were radiant and melting.  So were his in the thrill that pervaded him; nor did he realize how much that was radiant and melting in her eyes had been aroused by what she had seen in his.

Across the table from him, cater-cornered, at Mr. Morse’s right, sat Judge Blount, a local superior court judge.  Martin had met him a number of times and had failed to like him.  He and Ruth’s father were discussing labor union politics, the local situation, and socialism, and Mr. Morse was endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter topic.  At last Judge Blount looked across the table with benignant and fatherly pity.  Martin smiled to himself.

“You’ll grow out of it, young man,” he said soothingly.  “Time is the best cure for such youthful distempers.”  He turned to Mr. Morse.  “I do not believe discussion is good in such cases.  It makes the patient obstinate.”

“That is true,” the other assented gravely.  “But it is well to warn the patient occasionally of his condition.”

Martin laughed merrily, but it was with an effort.  The day had been too long, the day’s effort too intense, and he was deep in the throes of the reaction.

“Undoubtedly you are both excellent doctors,” he said; “but if you care a whit for the opinion of the patient, let him tell you that you are poor diagnosticians.  In fact, you are both suffering from the disease you think you find in me.  As for me, I am immune.  The socialist philosophy that riots half-baked in your veins has passed me by.”

“Clever, clever,” murmured the judge.  “An excellent ruse in controversy, to reverse positions.”

“Out of your mouth.”  Martin’s eyes were sparkling, but he kept control of himself.  “You see, Judge, I’ve heard your campaign speeches.  By some henidical process—henidical, by the way is a favorite word of mine which nobody understands—by some henidical process you persuade yourself that you believe in the competitive system and the survival of the strong, and at the same time you indorse with might and main all sorts of measures to shear the strength from the strong.”

“My young man—”

“Remember, I’ve heard your campaign speeches,” Martin warned.  “It’s on record, your position on interstate commerce regulation, on regulation of the railway trust and Standard Oil, on the conservation of the forests, on a thousand and one restrictive measures that are nothing else than socialistic.”

“Do you mean to tell me that you do not believe in regulating these various outrageous exercises of power?”

“That’s not the point.  I mean to tell you that you are a poor diagnostician.  I mean to tell you that I am not suffering from the microbe of socialism.  I mean to tell you that it is you who are suffering from the emasculating ravages of that same microbe.  As for me, I am an inveterate opponent of socialism just as I am an inveterate opponent of your own mongrel democracy that is nothing else than pseudo-socialism masquerading under a garb of words that will not stand the test of the dictionary.”

“I am a reactionary—so complete a reactionary that my position is incomprehensible to you who live in a veiled lie of social organization and whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil.  You make believe that you believe in the survival of the strong and the rule of the strong.  I believe.  That is the difference.  When I was a trifle younger,—a few months younger,—I believed the same thing.  You see, the ideas of you and yours had impressed me.  But merchants and traders are cowardly rulers at best; they grunt and grub all their days in the trough of money-getting, and I have swung back to aristocracy, if you please.  I am the only individualist in this room.  I look to the state for nothing.  I look only to the strong man, the man on horseback, to save the state from its own rotten futility.”

“Nietzsche was right.  I won’t take the time to tell you who Nietzsche was, but he was right.  The world belongs to the strong—to the strong who are noble as well and who do not wallow in the swine-trough of trade and exchange.  The world belongs to the true nobleman, to the great blond beasts, to the noncompromisers, to the ‘yes-sayers.’  And they will eat you up, you socialists—who are afraid of socialism and who think yourselves individualists.  Your slave-morality of the meek and lowly will never save you.—Oh, it’s all Greek, I know, and I won’t bother you any more with it.  But remember one thing.  There aren’t half a dozen individualists in Oakland, but Martin Eden is one of them.”

He signified that he was done with the discussion, and turned to Ruth.

“I’m wrought up to-day,” he said in an undertone.  “All I want to do is to love, not talk.”

He ignored Mr. Morse, who said:-

“I am unconvinced.  All socialists are Jesuits.  That is the way to tell them.”

“We’ll make a good Republican out of you yet,” said Judge Blount.

“The man on horseback will arrive before that time,” Martin retorted with good humor, and returned to Ruth.

But Mr. Morse was not content.  He did not like the laziness and the disinclination for sober, legitimate work of this prospective son-in-law of his, for whose ideas he had no respect and of whose nature he had no understanding.  So he turned the conversation to Herbert Spencer.  Judge Blount ably seconded him, and Martin, whose ears had pricked at the first mention of the philosopher’s name, listened to the judge enunciate a grave and complacent diatribe against Spencer.  From time to time Mr. Morse glanced at Martin, as much as to say, “There, my boy, you see.”

“Chattering daws,” Martin muttered under his breath, and went on talking with Ruth and Arthur.

But the long day and the “real dirt” of the night before were telling upon him; and, besides, still in his burnt mind was what had made him angry when he read it on the car.

“What is the matter?” Ruth asked suddenly alarmed by the effort he was making to contain himself.

“There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is its prophet,” Judge Blount was saying at that moment.

Martin turned upon him.

“A cheap judgment,” he remarked quietly.  “I heard it first in the City Hall Park, on the lips of a workingman who ought to have known better.  I have heard it often since, and each time the clap-trap of it nauseates me.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  To hear that great and noble man’s name upon your lips is like finding a dew-drop in a cesspool.  You are disgusting.”

It was like a thunderbolt.  Judge Blount glared at him with apoplectic countenance, and silence reigned.  Mr. Morse was secretly pleased.  He could see that his daughter was shocked.  It was what he wanted to do—to bring out the innate ruffianism of this man he did not like.

Ruth’s hand sought Martin’s beseechingly under the table, but his blood was up.  He was inflamed by the intellectual pretence and fraud of those who sat in the high places.  A Superior Court Judge!  It was only several years before that he had looked up from the mire at such glorious entities and deemed them gods.

Judge Blount recovered himself and attempted to go on, addressing himself to Martin with an assumption of politeness that the latter understood was for the benefit of the ladies.  Even this added to his anger.  Was there no honesty in the world?

“You can’t discuss Spencer with me,” he cried.  “You do not know any more about Spencer than do his own countrymen.  But it is no fault of yours, I grant.  It is just a phase of the contemptible ignorance of the times.  I ran across a sample of it on my way here this evening.  I was reading an essay by Saleeby on Spencer.  You should read it.  It is accessible to all men.  You can buy it in any book-store or draw it from the public library.  You would feel ashamed of your paucity of abuse and ignorance of that noble man compared with what Saleeby has collected on the subject.  It is a record of shame that would shame your shame.”

“‘The philosopher of the half-educated,’ he was called by an academic Philosopher who was not worthy to pollute the atmosphere he breathed.  I don’t think you have read ten pages of Spencer, but there have been critics, assumably more intelligent than you, who have read no more than you of Spencer, who publicly challenged his followers to adduce one single idea from all his writings—from Herbert Spencer’s writings, the man who has impressed the stamp of his genius over the whole field of scientific research and modern thought; the father of psychology; the man who revolutionized pedagogy, so that to-day the child of the French peasant is taught the three R’s according to principles laid down by him.  And the little gnats of men sting his memory when they get their very bread and butter from the technical application of his ideas.  What little of worth resides in their brains is largely due to him.  It is certain that had he never lived, most of what is correct in their parrot-learned knowledge would be absent.”

“And yet a man like Principal Fairbanks of Oxford—a man who sits in an even higher place than you, Judge Blount—has said that Spencer will be dismissed by posterity as a poet and dreamer rather than a thinker.  Yappers and blatherskites, the whole brood of them!  ‘“First Principles” is not wholly destitute of a certain literary power,’ said one of them.  And others of them have said that he was an industrious plodder rather than an original thinker.  Yappers and blatherskites!  Yappers and blatherskites!”

Martin ceased abruptly, in a dead silence.  Everybody in Ruth’s family looked up to Judge Blount as a man of power and achievement, and they were horrified at Martin’s outbreak.  The remainder of the dinner passed like a funeral, the judge and Mr. Morse confining their talk to each other, and the rest of the conversation being extremely desultory.  Then afterward, when Ruth and Martin were alone, there was a scene.

“You are unbearable,” she wept.

But his anger still smouldered, and he kept muttering, “The beasts!  The beasts!”

When she averred he had insulted the judge, he retorted:-

“By telling the truth about him?”

“I don’t care whether it was true or not,” she insisted.  “There are certain bounds of decency, and you had no license to insult anybody.”

“Then where did Judge Blount get the license to assault truth?” Martin demanded.  “Surely to assault truth is a more serious misdemeanor than to insult a pygmy personality such as the judge’s.  He did worse than that.  He blackened the name of a great, noble man who is dead.  Oh, the beasts!  The beasts!”

His complex anger flamed afresh, and Ruth was in terror of him.  Never had she seen him so angry, and it was all mystified and unreasonable to her comprehension.  And yet, through her very terror ran the fibres of fascination that had drawn and that still drew her to him—that had compelled her to lean towards him, and, in that mad, culminating moment, lay her hands upon his neck.  She was hurt and outraged by what had taken place, and yet she lay in his arms and quivered while he went on muttering, “The beasts!  The beasts!”  And she still lay there when he said: “I’ll not bother your table again, dear.  They do not like me, and it is wrong of me to thrust my objectionable presence upon them.  Besides, they are just as objectionable to me.  Faugh!  They are sickening.  And to think of it, I dreamed in my innocence that the persons who sat in the high places, who lived in fine houses and had educations and bank accounts, were worth while!”

CHAPTER XXXVIII

“Come on, let’s go down to the local.”

So spoke Brissenden, faint from a hemorrhage of half an hour before—the second hemorrhage in three days.  The perennial whiskey glass was in his hands, and he drained it with shaking fingers.

“What do I want with socialism?” Martin demanded.

“Outsiders are allowed five-minute speeches,” the sick man urged.  “Get up and spout.  Tell them why you don’t want socialism.  Tell them what you think about them and their ghetto ethics.  Slam Nietzsche into them and get walloped for your pains.  Make a scrap of it.  It will do them good.  Discussion is what they want, and what you want, too.  You see, I’d like to see you a socialist before I’m gone.  It will give you a sanction for your existence.  It is the one thing that will save you in the time of disappointment that is coming to you.”

“I never can puzzle out why you, of all men, are a socialist,” Martin pondered.  “You detest the crowd so.  Surely there is nothing in the canaille to recommend it to your aesthetic soul.”  He pointed an accusing finger at the whiskey glass which the other was refilling.  “Socialism doesn’t seem to save you.”

“I’m very sick,” was the answer.  “With you it is different.  You have health and much to live for, and you must be handcuffed to life somehow.  As for me, you wonder why I am a socialist.  I’ll tell you.  It is because Socialism is inevitable; because the present rotten and irrational system cannot endure; because the day is past for your man on horseback.  The slaves won’t stand for it.  They are too many, and willy-nilly they’ll drag down the would-be equestrian before ever he gets astride.  You can’t get away from them, and you’ll have to swallow the whole slave-morality.  It’s not a nice mess, I’ll allow.  But it’s been a-brewing and swallow it you must.  You are antediluvian anyway, with your Nietzsche ideas.  The past is past, and the man who says history repeats itself is a liar.  Of course I don’t like the crowd, but what’s a poor chap to do?  We can’t have the man on horseback, and anything is preferable to the timid swine that now rule.  But come on, anyway.  I’m loaded to the guards now, and if I sit here any longer, I’ll get drunk.  And you know the doctor says—damn the doctor!  I’ll fool him yet.”

It was Sunday night, and they found the small hall packed by the Oakland socialists, chiefly members of the working class.  The speaker, a clever Jew, won Martin’s admiration at the same time that he aroused his antagonism.  The man’s stooped and narrow shoulders and weazened chest proclaimed him the true child of the crowded ghetto, and strong on Martin was the age-long struggle of the feeble, wretched slaves against the lordly handful of men who had ruled over them and would rule over them to the end of time.  To Martin this withered wisp of a creature was a symbol.  He was the figure that stood forth representative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings and inefficients who perished according to biological law on the ragged confines of life.  They were the unfit.  In spite of their cunning philosophy and of their antlike proclivities for coöperation, Nature rejected them for the exceptional man.  Out of the plentiful spawn of life she flung from her prolific hand she selected only the best.  It was by the same method that men, aping her, bred race-horses and cucumbers.  Doubtless, a creator of a Cosmos could have devised a better method; but creatures of this particular Cosmos must put up with this particular method.  Of course, they could squirm as they perished, as the socialists squirmed, as the speaker on the platform and the perspiring crowd were squirming even now as they counselled together for some new device with which to minimize the penalties of living and outwit the Cosmos.

So Martin thought, and so he spoke when Brissenden urged him to give them hell.  He obeyed the mandate, walking up to the platform, as was the custom, and addressing the chairman.  He began in a low voice, haltingly, forming into order the ideas which had surged in his brain while the Jew was speaking.  In such meetings five minutes was the time allotted to each speaker; but when Martin’s five minutes were up, he was in full stride, his attack upon their doctrines but half completed.  He had caught their interest, and the audience urged the chairman by acclamation to extend Martin’s time.  They appreciated him as a foeman worthy of their intellect, and they listened intently, following every word.  He spoke with fire and conviction, mincing no words in his attack upon the slaves and their morality and tactics and frankly alluding to his hearers as the slaves in question.  He quoted Spencer and Malthus, and enunciated the biological law of development.

“And so,” he concluded, in a swift résumé, “no state composed of the slave-types can endure.  The old law of development still holds.  In the struggle for existence, as I have shown, the strong and the progeny of the strong tend to survive, while the weak and the progeny of the weak are crushed and tend to perish.  The result is that the strong and the progeny of the strong survive, and, so long as the struggle obtains, the strength of each generation increases.  That is development.  But you slaves—it is too bad to be slaves, I grant—but you slaves dream of a society where the law of development will be annulled, where no weaklings and inefficients will perish, where every inefficient will have as much as he wants to eat as many times a day as he desires, and where all will marry and have progeny—the weak as well as the strong.  What will be the result?  No longer will the strength and life-value of each generation increase.  On the contrary, it will diminish.  There is the Nemesis of your slave philosophy.  Your society of slaves—of, by, and for, slaves—must inevitably weaken and go to pieces as the life which composes it weakens and goes to pieces.

“Remember, I am enunciating biology and not sentimental ethics.  No state of slaves can stand—”

“How about the United States?” a man yelled from the audience.

“And how about it?” Martin retorted.  “The thirteen colonies threw off their rulers and formed the Republic so-called.  The slaves were their own masters.  There were no more masters of the sword.  But you couldn’t get along without masters of some sort, and there arose a new set of masters—not the great, virile, noble men, but the shrewd and spidery traders and money-lenders.  And they enslaved you over again—but not frankly, as the true, noble men would do with weight of their own right arms, but secretly, by spidery machinations and by wheedling and cajolery and lies.  They have purchased your slave judges, they have debauched your slave legislatures, and they have forced to worse horrors than chattel slavery your slave boys and girls.  Two million of your children are toiling to-day in this trader-oligarchy of the United States.  Ten millions of you slaves are not properly sheltered nor properly fed.”

“But to return.  I have shown that no society of slaves can endure, because, in its very nature, such society must annul the law of development.  No sooner can a slave society be organized than deterioration sets in.  It is easy for you to talk of annulling the law of development, but where is the new law of development that will maintain your strength?  Formulate it.  Is it already formulated?  Then state it.”

Martin took his seat amidst an uproar of voices.  A score of men were on their feet clamoring for recognition from the chair.  And one by one, encouraged by vociferous applause, speaking with fire and enthusiasm and excited gestures, they replied to the attack.  It was a wild night—but it was wild intellectually, a battle of ideas.  Some strayed from the point, but most of the speakers replied directly to Martin.  They shook him with lines of thought that were new to him; and gave him insights, not into new biological laws, but into new applications of the old laws.  They were too earnest to be always polite, and more than once the chairman rapped and pounded for order.

It chanced that a cub reporter sat in the audience, detailed there on a day dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism for sensation.  He was not a bright cub reporter.  He was merely facile and glib.  He was too dense to follow the discussion.  In fact, he had a comfortable feeling that he was vastly superior to these wordy maniacs of the working class.  Also, he had a great respect for those who sat in the high places and dictated the policies of nations and newspapers.  Further, he had an ideal, namely, of achieving that excellence of the perfect reporter who is able to make something—even a great deal—out of nothing.

He did not know what all the talk was about.  It was not necessary.  Words like revolution gave him his cue.  Like a paleontologist, able to reconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone, he was able to reconstruct a whole speech from the one word revolution.  He did it that night, and he did it well; and since Martin had made the biggest stir, he put it all into his mouth and made him the arch-anarch of the show, transforming his reactionary individualism into the most lurid, red-shirt socialist utterance.  The cub reporter was an artist, and it was a large brush with which he laid on the local color—wild-eyed long-haired men, neurasthenia and degenerate types of men, voices shaken with passion, clenched fists raised on high, and all projected against a background of oaths, yells, and the throaty rumbling of angry men.

CHAPTER XXXIX

Over the coffee, in his little room, Martin read next morning’s paper.  It was a novel experience to find himself head-lined, on the first page at that; and he was surprised to learn that he was the most notorious leader of the Oakland socialists.  He ran over the violent speech the cub reporter had constructed for him, and, though at first he was angered by the fabrication, in the end he tossed the paper aside with a laugh.

“Either the man was drunk or criminally malicious,” he said that afternoon, from his perch on the bed, when Brissenden had arrived and dropped limply into the one chair.

“But what do you care?” Brissenden asked.  “Surely you don’t desire the approval of the bourgeois swine that read the newspapers?”

Martin thought for a while, then said:-

“No, I really don’t care for their approval, not a whit.  On the other hand, it’s very likely to make my relations with Ruth’s family a trifle awkward.  Her father always contended I was a socialist, and this miserable stuff will clinch his belief.  Not that I care for his opinion—but what’s the odds?  I want to read you what I’ve been doing to-day.  It’s ‘Overdue,’ of course, and I’m just about halfway through.”

He was reading aloud when Maria thrust open the door and ushered in a young man in a natty suit who glanced briskly about him, noting the oil-burner and the kitchen in the corner before his gaze wandered on to Martin.

“Sit down,” Brissenden said.

Martin made room for the young man on the bed and waited for him to broach his business.

“I heard you speak last night, Mr. Eden, and I’ve come to interview you,” he began.

Brissenden burst out in a hearty laugh.

“A brother socialist?” the reporter asked, with a quick glance at Brissenden that appraised the color-value of that cadaverous and dying man.

“And he wrote that report,” Martin said softly.  “Why, he is only a boy!”

“Why don’t you poke him?” Brissenden asked.  “I’d give a thousand dollars to have my lungs back for five minutes.”

The cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him and around him and at him.  But he had been commended for his brilliant description of the socialist meeting and had further been detailed to get a personal interview with Martin Eden, the leader of the organized menace to society.

“You do not object to having your picture taken, Mr. Eden?” he said.  “I’ve a staff photographer outside, you see, and he says it will be better to take you right away before the sun gets lower.  Then we can have the interview afterward.”

“A photographer,” Brissenden said meditatively.  “Poke him, Martin!  Poke him!”

“I guess I’m getting old,” was the answer.  “I know I ought, but I really haven’t the heart.  It doesn’t seem to matter.”

“For his mother’s sake,” Brissenden urged.

“It’s worth considering,” Martin replied; “but it doesn’t seem worth while enough to rouse sufficient energy in me.  You see, it does take energy to give a fellow a poking.  Besides, what does it matter?”

“That’s right—that’s the way to take it,” the cub announced airily, though he had already begun to glance anxiously at the door.

“But it wasn’t true, not a word of what he wrote,” Martin went on, confining his attention to Brissenden.

“It was just in a general way a description, you understand,” the cub ventured, “and besides, it’s good advertising.  That’s what counts.  It was a favor to you.”

“It’s good advertising, Martin, old boy,” Brissenden repeated solemnly.

“And it was a favor to me—think of that!” was Martin’s contribution.

“Let me see—where were you born, Mr. Eden?” the cub asked, assuming an air of expectant attention.

“He doesn’t take notes,” said Brissenden.  “He remembers it all.”

“That is sufficient for me.”  The cub was trying not to look worried.  “No decent reporter needs to bother with notes.”

“That was sufficient—for last night.”  But Brissenden was not a disciple of quietism, and he changed his attitude abruptly.  “Martin, if you don’t poke him, I’ll do it myself, if I fall dead on the floor the next moment.”

“How will a spanking do?” Martin asked.

Brissenden considered judicially, and nodded his head.

The next instant Martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the cub face downward across his knees.

“Now don’t bite,” Martin warned, “or else I’ll have to punch your face.  It would be a pity, for it is such a pretty face.”

His uplifted hand descended, and thereafter rose and fell in a swift and steady rhythm.  The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed, but did not offer to bite.  Brissenden looked on gravely, though once he grew excited and gripped the whiskey bottle, pleading, “Here, just let me swat him once.”

“Sorry my hand played out,” Martin said, when at last he desisted.  “It is quite numb.”

He uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed.

“I’ll have you arrested for this,” he snarled, tears of boyish indignation running down his flushed cheeks.  “I’ll make you sweat for this.  You’ll see.”

“The pretty thing,” Martin remarked.  “He doesn’t realize that he has entered upon the downward path.  It is not honest, it is not square, it is not manly, to tell lies about one’s fellow-creatures the way he has done, and he doesn’t know it.”

“He has to come to us to be told,” Brissenden filled in a pause.

“Yes, to me whom he has maligned and injured.  My grocery will undoubtedly refuse me credit now.  The worst of it is that the poor boy will keep on this way until he deteriorates into a first-class newspaper man and also a first-class scoundrel.”

“But there is yet time,” quoth Brissenden.  “Who knows but what you may prove the humble instrument to save him.  Why didn’t you let me swat him just once?  I’d like to have had a hand in it.”

“I’ll have you arrested, the pair of you, you b-b-big brutes,” sobbed the erring soul.

“No, his mouth is too pretty and too weak.”  Martin shook his head lugubriously.  “I’m afraid I’ve numbed my hand in vain.  The young man cannot reform.  He will become eventually a very great and successful newspaper man.  He has no conscience.  That alone will make him great.”

With that the cub passed out the door in trepidation to the last for fear that Brissenden would hit him in the back with the bottle he still clutched.

In the next morning’s paper Martin learned a great deal more about himself that was new to him.  “We are the sworn enemies of society,” he found himself quoted as saying in a column interview.  “No, we are not anarchists but socialists.”  When the reporter pointed out to him that there seemed little difference between the two schools, Martin had shrugged his shoulders in silent affirmation.  His face was described as bilaterally asymmetrical, and various other signs of degeneration were described.  Especially notable were his thuglike hands and the fiery gleams in his blood-shot eyes.

He learned, also, that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the City Hall Park, and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed the minds of the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most revolutionary speeches.  The cub painted a high-light picture of his poor little room, its oil-stove and the one chair, and of the death’s-head tramp who kept him company and who looked as if he had just emerged from twenty years of solitary confinement in some fortress dungeon.

The cub had been industrious.  He had scurried around and nosed out Martin’s family history, and procured a photograph of Higginbotham’s Cash Store with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out in front.  That gentleman was depicted as an intelligent, dignified businessman who had no patience with his brother-in-law’s socialistic views, and no patience with the brother-in-law, either, whom he was quoted as characterizing as a lazy good-for-nothing who wouldn’t take a job when it was offered to him and who would go to jail yet.  Hermann Von Schmidt, Marian’s husband, had likewise been interviewed.  He had called Martin the black sheep of the family and repudiated him.  “He tried to sponge off of me, but I put a stop to that good and quick,” Von Schmidt had said to the reporter.  “He knows better than to come bumming around here.  A man who won’t work is no good, take that from me.”

This time Martin was genuinely angry.  Brissenden looked upon the affair as a good joke, but he could not console Martin, who knew that it would be no easy task to explain to Ruth.  As for her father, he knew that he must be overjoyed with what had happened and that he would make the most of it to break off the engagement.  How much he would make of it he was soon to realize.  The afternoon mail brought a letter from Ruth.  Martin opened it with a premonition of disaster, and read it standing at the open door when he had received it from the postman.  As he read, mechanically his hand sought his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper of his old cigarette days.  He was not aware that the pocket was empty or that he had even reached for the materials with which to roll a cigarette.

It was not a passionate letter.  There were no touches of anger in it.  But all the way through, from the first sentence to the last, was sounded the note of hurt and disappointment.  She had expected better of him.  She had thought he had got over his youthful wildness, that her love for him had been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live seriously and decently.  And now her father and mother had taken a firm stand and commanded that the engagement be broken.  That they were justified in this she could not but admit.  Their relation could never be a happy one.  It had been unfortunate from the first.  But one regret she voiced in the whole letter, and it was a bitter one to Martin.  “If only you had settled down to some position and attempted to make something of yourself,” she wrote.  “But it was not to be.  Your past life had been too wild and irregular.  I can understand that you are not to be blamed.  You could act only according to your nature and your early training.  So I do not blame you, Martin.  Please remember that.  It was simply a mistake.  As father and mother have contended, we were not made for each other, and we should both be happy because it was discovered not too late.” . . “There is no use trying to see me,” she said toward the last.  “It would be an unhappy meeting for both of us, as well as for my mother.  I feel, as it is, that I have caused her great pain and worry.  I shall have to do much living to atone for it.”

He read it through to the end, carefully, a second time, then sat down and replied.  He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist meeting, pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what the newspaper had put in his mouth.  Toward the end of the letter he was God’s own lover pleading passionately for love.  “Please answer,” he said, “and in your answer you have to tell me but one thing.  Do you love me?  That is all—the answer to that one question.”

But no answer came the next day, nor the next.  “Overdue” lay untouched upon the table, and each day the heap of returned manuscripts under the table grew larger.  For the first time Martin’s glorious sleep was interrupted by insomnia, and he tossed through long, restless nights.  Three times he called at the Morse home, but was turned away by the servant who answered the bell.  Brissenden lay sick in his hotel, too feeble to stir out, and, though Martin was with him often, he did not worry him with his troubles.

For Martin’s troubles were many.  The aftermath of the cub reporter’s deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated.  The Portuguese grocer refused him further credit, while the greengrocer, who was an American and proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused further dealings with him—carrying his patriotism to such a degree that he cancelled Martin’s account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it.  The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and indignation against Martin ran high.  No one would have anything to do with a socialist traitor.  Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but she remained loyal.  The children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which once had visited Martin, and from safe distances they called him “hobo” and “bum.”  The Silva tribe, however, stanchly defended him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his honor, and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day and added to Maria’s perplexities and troubles.

Once, Martin met Gertrude on the street, down in Oakland, and learned what he knew could not be otherwise—that Bernard Higginbotham was furious with him for having dragged the family into public disgrace, and that he had forbidden him the house.

“Why don’t you go away, Martin?” Gertrude had begged.  “Go away and get a job somewhere and steady down.  Afterwards, when this all blows over, you can come back.”

Martin shook his head, but gave no explanations.  How could he explain?  He was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him and his people.  He could never cross it and explain to them his position,—the Nietzschean position, in regard to socialism.  There were not words enough in the English language, nor in any language, to make his attitude and conduct intelligible to them.  Their highest concept of right conduct, in his case, was to get a job.  That was their first word and their last.  It constituted their whole lexicon of ideas.  Get a job!  Go to work!  Poor, stupid slaves, he thought, while his sister talked.  Small wonder the world belonged to the strong.  The slaves were obsessed by their own slavery.  A job was to them a golden fetich before which they fell down and worshipped.

He shook his head again, when Gertrude offered him money, though he knew that within the day he would have to make a trip to the pawnbroker.

“Don’t come near Bernard now,” she admonished him.  “After a few months, when he is cooled down, if you want to, you can get the job of drivin’ delivery-wagon for him.  Any time you want me, just send for me an’ I’ll come.  Don’t forget.”

She went away weeping audibly, and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot through him at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait.  As he watched her go, the Nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter.  The slave-class in the abstract was all very well, but it was not wholly satisfactory when it was brought home to his own family.  And yet, if there was ever a slave trampled by the strong, that slave was his sister Gertrude.  He grinned savagely at the paradox.  A fine Nietzsche-man he was, to allow his intellectual concepts to be shaken by the first sentiment or emotion that strayed along—ay, to be shaken by the slave-morality itself, for that was what his pity for his sister really was.  The true noble men were above pity and compassion.  Pity and compassion had been generated in the subterranean barracoons of the slaves and were no more than the agony and sweat of the crowded miserables and weaklings.

CHAPTER XL

“Overdue” still continued to lie forgotten on the table.  Every manuscript that he had had out now lay under the table.  Only one manuscript he kept going, and that was Brissenden’s “Ephemera.”  His bicycle and black suit were again in pawn, and the type-writer people were once more worrying about the rent.  But such things no longer bothered him.  He was seeking a new orientation, and until that was found his life must stand still.

After several weeks, what he had been waiting for happened.  He met Ruth on the street.  It was true, she was accompanied by her brother, Norman, and it was true that they tried to ignore him and that Norman attempted to wave him aside.

“If you interfere with my sister, I’ll call an officer,” Norman threatened.  “She does not wish to speak with you, and your insistence is insult.”

“If you persist, you’ll have to call that officer, and then you’ll get your name in the papers,” Martin answered grimly.  “And now, get out of my way and get the officer if you want to.  I’m going to talk with Ruth.”

“I want to have it from your own lips,” he said to her.

She was pale and trembling, but she held up and looked inquiringly.

“The question I asked in my letter,” he prompted.

Norman made an impatient movement, but Martin checked him with a swift look.

She shook her head.

“Is all this of your own free will?” he demanded.

“It is.”  She spoke in a low, firm voice and with deliberation.  “It is of my own free will.  You have disgraced me so that I am ashamed to meet my friends.  They are all talking about me, I know.  That is all I can tell you.  You have made me very unhappy, and I never wish to see you again.”

“Friends!  Gossip!  Newspaper misreports!  Surely such things are not stronger than love!  I can only believe that you never loved me.”

A blush drove the pallor from her face.

“After what has passed?” she said faintly.  “Martin, you do not know what you are saying.  I am not common.”

“You see, she doesn’t want to have anything to do with you,” Norman blurted out, starting on with her.

Martin stood aside and let them pass, fumbling unconsciously in his coat pocket for the tobacco and brown papers that were not there.

It was a long walk to North Oakland, but it was not until he went up the steps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it.  He found himself sitting on the edge of the bed and staring about him like an awakened somnambulist.  He noticed “Overdue” lying on the table and drew up his chair and reached for his pen.  There was in his nature a logical compulsion toward completeness.  Here was something undone.  It had been deferred against the completion of something else.  Now that something else had been finished, and he would apply himself to this task until it was finished.  What he would do next he did not know.  All that he did know was that a climacteric in his life had been attained.  A period had been reached, and he was rounding it off in workman-like fashion.  He was not curious about the future.  He would soon enough find out what it held in store for him.  Whatever it was, it did not matter.  Nothing seemed to matter.

For five days he toiled on at “Overdue,” going nowhere, seeing nobody, and eating meagrely.  On the morning of the sixth day the postman brought him a thin letter from the editor of The Parthenon.  A glance told him that “Ephemera” was accepted.  “We have submitted the poem to Mr. Cartwright Bruce,” the editor went on to say, “and he has reported so favorably upon it that we cannot let it go.  As an earnest of our pleasure in publishing the poem, let me tell you that we have set it for the August number, our July number being already made up.  Kindly extend our pleasure and our thanks to Mr. Brissenden.  Please send by return mail his photograph and biographical data.  If our honorarium is unsatisfactory, kindly telegraph us at once and state what you consider a fair price.”

Since the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty dollars, Martin thought it not worth while to telegraph.  Then, too, there was Brissenden’s consent to be gained.  Well, he had been right, after all.  Here was one magazine editor who knew real poetry when he saw it.  And the price was splendid, even though it was for the poem of a century.  As for Cartwright Bruce, Martin knew that he was the one critic for whose opinions Brissenden had any respect.

Martin rode down town on an electric car, and as he watched the houses and cross-streets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not more elated over his friend’s success and over his own signal victory.  The one critic in the United States had pronounced favorably on the poem, while his own contention that good stuff could find its way into the magazines had proved correct.  But enthusiasm had lost its spring in him, and he found that he was more anxious to see Brissenden than he was to carry the good news.  The acceptance of The Parthenon had recalled to him that during his five days’ devotion to “Overdue” he had not heard from Brissenden nor even thought about him.  For the first time Martin realized the daze he had been in, and he felt shame for having forgotten his friend.  But even the shame did not burn very sharply.  He was numb to emotions of any sort save the artistic ones concerned in the writing of “Overdue.”  So far as other affairs were concerned, he had been in a trance.  For that matter, he was still in a trance.  All this life through which the electric car whirred seemed remote and unreal, and he would have experienced little interest and less shook if the great stone steeple of the church he passed had suddenly crumbled to mortar-dust upon his head.

At the hotel he hurried up to Brissenden’s room, and hurried down again.  The room was empty.  All luggage was gone.

“Did Mr. Brissenden leave any address?” he asked the clerk, who looked at him curiously for a moment.

“Haven’t you heard?” he asked.

Martin shook his head.

“Why, the papers were full of it.  He was found dead in bed.  Suicide.  Shot himself through the head.”

“Is he buried yet?” Martin seemed to hear his voice, like some one else’s voice, from a long way off, asking the question.

“No.  The body was shipped East after the inquest.  Lawyers engaged by his people saw to the arrangements.”

“They were quick about it, I must say,” Martin commented.

“Oh, I don’t know.  It happened five days ago.”

“Five days ago?”

“Yes, five days ago.”

“Oh,” Martin said as he turned and went out.

At the corner he stepped into the Western Union and sent a telegram to The Parthenon, advising them to proceed with the publication of the poem.  He had in his pocket but five cents with which to pay his carfare home, so he sent the message collect.

Once in his room, he resumed his writing.  The days and nights came and went, and he sat at his table and wrote on.  He went nowhere, save to the pawnbroker, took no exercise, and ate methodically when he was hungry and had something to cook, and just as methodically went without when he had nothing to cook.  Composed as the story was, in advance, chapter by chapter, he nevertheless saw and developed an opening that increased the power of it, though it necessitated twenty thousand additional words.  It was not that there was any vital need that the thing should be well done, but that his artistic canons compelled him to do it well.  He worked on in the daze, strangely detached from the world around him, feeling like a familiar ghost among these literary trappings of his former life.  He remembered that some one had said that a ghost was the spirit of a man who was dead and who did not have sense enough to know it; and he paused for the moment to wonder if he were really dead did unaware of it.

Came the day when “Overdue” was finished.  The agent of the type-writer firm had come for the machine, and he sat on the bed while Martin, on the one chair, typed the last pages of the final chapter.  “Finis,” he wrote, in capitals, at the end, and to him it was indeed finis.  He watched the type-writer carried out the door with a feeling of relief, then went over and lay down on the bed.  He was faint from hunger.  Food had not passed his lips in thirty-six hours, but he did not think about it.  He lay on his back, with closed eyes, and did not think at all, while the daze or stupor slowly welled up, saturating his consciousness.  Half in delirium, he began muttering aloud the lines of an anonymous poem Brissenden had been fond of quoting to him.  Maria, listening anxiously outside his door, was perturbed by his monotonous utterance.  The words in themselves were not significant to her, but the fact that he was saying them was.  “I have done,” was the burden of the poem.

“‘I have done—
Put by the lute.
Song and singing soon are over
As the airy shades that hover
In among the purple clover.
I have done—
Put by the lute.
Once I sang as early thrushes
Sing among the dewy bushes;
Now I’m mute.
I am like a weary linnet,
For my throat has no song in it;
I have had my singing minute.
I have done.
Put by the lute.’”

Maria could stand it no longer, and hurried away to the stove, where she filled a quart-bowl with soup, putting into it the lion’s share of chopped meat and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the bottom of the pot.  Martin roused himself and sat up and began to eat, between spoonfuls reassuring Maria that he had not been talking in his sleep and that he did not have any fever.

After she left him he sat drearily, with drooping shoulders, on the edge of the bed, gazing about him with lack-lustre eyes that saw nothing until the torn wrapper of a magazine, which had come in the morning’s mail and which lay unopened, shot a gleam of light into his darkened brain.  It is The Parthenon, he thought, the August Parthenon, and it must contain “Ephemera.”  If only Brissenden were here to see!

He was turning the pages of the magazine, when suddenly he stopped.  “Ephemera” had been featured, with gorgeous head-piece and Beardsley-like margin decorations.  On one side of the head-piece was Brissenden’s photograph, on the other side was the photograph of Sir John Value, the British Ambassador.  A preliminary editorial note quoted Sir John Value as saying that there were no poets in America, and the publication of “Ephemera” was The Parthenon’s.  “There, take that, Sir John Value!”  Cartwright Bruce was described as the greatest critic in America, and he was quoted as saying that “Ephemera” was the greatest poem ever written in America.  And finally, the editor’s foreword ended with: “We have not yet made up our minds entirely as to the merits of “Ephemera”; perhaps we shall never be able to do so.  But we have read it often, wondering at the words and their arrangement, wondering where Mr. Brissenden got them, and how he could fasten them together.”  Then followed the poem.

“Pretty good thing you died, Briss, old man,” Martin murmured, letting the magazine slip between his knees to the floor.

The cheapness and vulgarity of it was nauseating, and Martin noted apathetically that he was not nauseated very much.  He wished he could get angry, but did not have energy enough to try.  He was too numb.  His blood was too congealed to accelerate to the swift tidal flow of indignation.  After all, what did it matter?  It was on a par with all the rest that Brissenden had condemned in bourgeois society.

“Poor Briss,” Martin communed; “he would never have forgiven me.”

Rousing himself with an effort, he possessed himself of a box which had once contained type-writer paper.  Going through its contents, he drew forth eleven poems which his friend had written.  These he tore lengthwise and crosswise and dropped into the waste basket.  He did it languidly, and, when he had finished, sat on the edge of the bed staring blankly before him.

How long he sat there he did not know, until, suddenly, across his sightless vision he saw form a long horizontal line of white.  It was curious.  But as he watched it grow in definiteness he saw that it was a coral reef smoking in the white Pacific surges.  Next, in the line of breakers he made out a small canoe, an outrigger canoe.  In the stern he saw a young bronzed god in scarlet hip-cloth dipping a flashing paddle.  He recognized him.  He was Moti, the youngest son of Tati, the chief, and this was Tahiti, and beyond that smoking reef lay the sweet land of Papara and the chief’s grass house by the river’s mouth.  It was the end of the day, and Moti was coming home from the fishing.  He was waiting for the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the reef.  Then he saw himself, sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in the past, dipping a paddle that waited Moti’s word to dig in like mad when the turquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them.  Next, he was no longer an onlooker but was himself in the canoe, Moti was crying out, they were both thrusting hard with their paddles, racing on the steep face of the flying turquoise.  Under the bow the water was hissing as from a steam jet, the air was filled with driven spray, there was a rush and rumble and long-echoing roar, and the canoe floated on the placid water of the lagoon.  Moti laughed and shook the salt water from his eyes, and together they paddled in to the pounded-coral beach where Tati’s grass walls through the cocoanut-palms showed golden in the setting sun.

The picture faded, and before his eyes stretched the disorder of his squalid room.  He strove in vain to see Tahiti again.  He knew there was singing among the trees and that the maidens were dancing in the moonlight, but he could not see them.  He could see only the littered writing-table, the empty space where the type-writer had stood, and the unwashed window-pane.  He closed his eyes with a groan, and slept.

CHAPTER XLI

He slept heavily all night, and did not stir until aroused by the postman on his morning round.  Martin felt tired and passive, and went through his letters aimlessly.  One thin envelope, from a robber magazine, contained for twenty-two dollars.  He had been dunning for it for a year and a half.  He noted its amount apathetically.  The old-time thrill at receiving a publisher’s check was gone.  Unlike his earlier checks, this one was not pregnant with promise of great things to come.  To him it was a check for twenty-two dollars, that was all, and it would buy him something to eat.

Another check was in the same mail, sent from a New York weekly in payment for some humorous verse which had been accepted months before.  It was for ten dollars.  An idea came to him, which he calmly considered.  He did not know what he was going to do, and he felt in no hurry to do anything.  In the meantime he must live.  Also he owed numerous debts.  Would it not be a paying investment to put stamps on the huge pile of manuscripts under the table and start them on their travels again?  One or two of them might be accepted.  That would help him to live.  He decided on the investment, and, after he had cashed the checks at the bank down in Oakland, he bought ten dollars’ worth of postage stamps.  The thought of going home to cook breakfast in his stuffy little room was repulsive to him.  For the first time he refused to consider his debts.  He knew that in his room he could manufacture a substantial breakfast at a cost of from fifteen to twenty cents.  But, instead, he went into the Forum Café and ordered a breakfast that cost two dollars.  He tipped the waiter a quarter, and spent fifty cents for a package of Egyptian cigarettes.  It was the first time he had smoked since Ruth had asked him to stop.  But he could see now no reason why he should not, and besides, he wanted to smoke.  And what did the money matter?  For five cents he could have bought a package of Durham and brown papers and rolled forty cigarettes—but what of it?  Money had no meaning to him now except what it would immediately buy.  He was chartless and rudderless, and he had no port to make, while drifting involved the least living, and it was living that hurt.

The days slipped along, and he slept eight hours regularly every night.  Though now, while waiting for more checks, he ate in the Japanese restaurants where meals were served for ten cents, his wasted body filled out, as did the hollows in his cheeks.  He no longer abused himself with short sleep, overwork, and overstudy.  He wrote nothing, and the books were closed.  He walked much, out in the hills, and loafed long hours in the quiet parks.  He had no friends nor acquaintances, nor did he make any.  He had no inclination.  He was waiting for some impulse, from he knew not where, to put his stopped life into motion again.  In the meantime his life remained run down, planless, and empty and idle.

Once he made a trip to San Francisco to look up the “real dirt.”  But at the last moment, as he stepped into the upstairs entrance, he recoiled and turned and fled through the swarming ghetto.  He was frightened at the thought of hearing philosophy discussed, and he fled furtively, for fear that some one of the “real dirt” might chance along and recognize him.

Sometimes he glanced over the magazines and newspapers to see how “Ephemera” was being maltreated.  It had made a hit.  But what a hit!  Everybody had read it, and everybody was discussing whether or not it was really poetry.  The local papers had taken it up, and daily there appeared columns of learned criticisms, facetious editorials, and serious letters from subscribers.  Helen Della Delmar (proclaimed with a flourish of trumpets and rolling of tomtoms to be the greatest woman poet in the United States) denied Brissenden a seat beside her on Pegasus and wrote voluminous letters to the public, proving that he was no poet.

The Parthenon came out in its next number patting itself on the back for the stir it had made, sneering at Sir John Value, and exploiting Brissenden’s death with ruthless commercialism.  A newspaper with a sworn circulation of half a million published an original and spontaneous poem by Helen Della Delmar, in which she gibed and sneered at Brissenden.  Also, she was guilty of a second poem, in which she parodied him.

Martin had many times to be glad that Brissenden was dead.  He had hated the crowd so, and here all that was finest and most sacred of him had been thrown to the crowd.  Daily the vivisection of Beauty went on.  Every nincompoop in the land rushed into free print, floating their wizened little egos into the public eye on the surge of Brissenden’s greatness.  Quoth one paper: “We have received a letter from a gentleman who wrote a poem just like it, only better, some time ago.”  Another paper, in deadly seriousness, reproving Helen Della Delmar for her parody, said: “But unquestionably Miss Delmar wrote it in a moment of badinage and not quite with the respect that one great poet should show to another and perhaps to the greatest.  However, whether Miss Delmar be jealous or not of the man who invented ‘Ephemera,’ it is certain that she, like thousands of others, is fascinated by his work, and that the day may come when she will try to write lines like his.”

Ministers began to preach sermons against “Ephemera,” and one, who too stoutly stood for much of its content, was expelled for heresy.  The great poem contributed to the gayety of the world.  The comic verse-writers and the cartoonists took hold of it with screaming laughter, and in the personal columns of society weeklies jokes were perpetrated on it to the effect that Charley Frensham told Archie Jennings, in confidence, that five lines of “Ephemera” would drive a man to beat a cripple, and that ten lines would send him to the bottom of the river.

Martin did not laugh; nor did he grit his teeth in anger.  The effect produced upon him was one of great sadness.  In the crash of his whole world, with love on the pinnacle, the crash of magazinedom and the dear public was a small crash indeed.  Brissenden had been wholly right in his judgment of the magazines, and he, Martin, had spent arduous and futile years in order to find it out for himself.  The magazines were all Brissenden had said they were and more.  Well, he was done, he solaced himself.  He had hitched his wagon to a star and been landed in a pestiferous marsh.  The visions of Tahiti—clean, sweet Tahiti—were coming to him more frequently.  And there were the low Paumotus, and the high Marquesas; he saw himself often, now, on board trading schooners or frail little cutters, slipping out at dawn through the reef at Papeete and beginning the long beat through the pearl-atolls to Nukahiva and the Bay of Taiohae, where Tamari, he knew, would kill a pig in honor of his coming, and where Tamari’s flower-garlanded daughters would seize his hands and with song and laughter garland him with flowers.  The South Seas were calling, and he knew that sooner or later he would answer the call.

In the meantime he drifted, resting and recuperating after the long traverse he had made through the realm of knowledge.  When The Parthenon check of three hundred and fifty dollars was forwarded to him, he turned it over to the local lawyer who had attended to Brissenden’s affairs for his family.  Martin took a receipt for the check, and at the same time gave a note for the hundred dollars Brissenden had let him have.

The time was not long when Martin ceased patronizing the Japanese restaurants.  At the very moment when he had abandoned the fight, the tide turned.  But it had turned too late.  Without a thrill he opened a thick envelope from The Millennium, scanned the face of a check that represented three hundred dollars, and noted that it was the payment on acceptance for “Adventure.”  Every debt he owed in the world, including the pawnshop, with its usurious interest, amounted to less than a hundred dollars.  And when he had paid everything, and lifted the hundred-dollar note with Brissenden’s lawyer, he still had over a hundred dollars in pocket.  He ordered a suit of clothes from the tailor and ate his meals in the best cafés in town.  He still slept in his little room at Maria’s, but the sight of his new clothes caused the neighborhood children to cease from calling him “hobo” and “tramp” from the roofs of woodsheds and over back fences.

“Wiki-Wiki,” his Hawaiian short story, was bought by Warren’s Monthly for two hundred and fifty dollars.  The Northern Review took his essay, “The Cradle of Beauty,” and Mackintosh’s Magazine took “The Palmist”—the poem he had written to Marian.  The editors and readers were back from their summer vacations, and manuscripts were being handled quickly.  But Martin could not puzzle out what strange whim animated them to this general acceptance of the things they had persistently rejected for two years.  Nothing of his had been published.  He was not known anywhere outside of Oakland, and in Oakland, with the few who thought they knew him, he was notorious as a red-shirt and a socialist.  So there was no explaining this sudden acceptability of his wares.  It was sheer jugglery of fate.

After it had been refused by a number of magazines, he had taken Brissenden’s rejected advice and started, “The Shame of the Sun” on the round of publishers.  After several refusals, Singletree, Darnley & Co. accepted it, promising fall publication.  When Martin asked for an advance on royalties, they wrote that such was not their custom, that books of that nature rarely paid for themselves, and that they doubted if his book would sell a thousand copies.  Martin figured what the book would earn him on such a sale.  Retailed at a dollar, on a royalty of fifteen per cent, it would bring him one hundred and fifty dollars.  He decided that if he had it to do over again he would confine himself to fiction.  “Adventure,” one-fourth as long, had brought him twice as much from The Millennium.  That newspaper paragraph he had read so long ago had been true, after all.  The first-class magazines did not pay on acceptance, and they paid well.  Not two cents a word, but four cents a word, had The Millennium paid him.  And, furthermore, they bought good stuff, too, for were they not buying his?  This last thought he accompanied with a grin.

He wrote to Singletree, Darnley & Co., offering to sell out his rights in “The Shame of the Sun” for a hundred dollars, but they did not care to take the risk.  In the meantime he was not in need of money, for several of his later stories had been accepted and paid for.  He actually opened a bank account, where, without a debt in the world, he had several hundred dollars to his credit.  “Overdue,” after having been declined by a number of magazines, came to rest at the Meredith-Lowell Company.  Martin remembered the five dollars Gertrude had given him, and his resolve to return it to her a hundred times over; so he wrote for an advance on royalties of five hundred dollars.  To his surprise a check for that amount, accompanied by a contract, came by return mail.  He cashed the check into five-dollar gold pieces and telephoned Gertrude that he wanted to see her.

She arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste she had made.  Apprehensive of trouble, she had stuffed the few dollars she possessed into her hand-satchel; and so sure was she that disaster had overtaken her brother, that she stumbled forward, sobbing, into his arms, at the same time thrusting the satchel mutely at him.

“I’d have come myself,” he said.  “But I didn’t want a row with Mr. Higginbotham, and that is what would have surely happened.”

“He’ll be all right after a time,” she assured him, while she wondered what the trouble was that Martin was in.  “But you’d best get a job first an’ steady down.  Bernard does like to see a man at honest work.  That stuff in the newspapers broke ’m all up.  I never saw ’m so mad before.”

“I’m not going to get a job,” Martin said with a smile.  “And you can tell him so from me.  I don’t need a job, and there’s the proof of it.”

He emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting, tinkling stream.

“You remember that fiver you gave me the time I didn’t have carfare?  Well, there it is, with ninety-nine brothers of different ages but all of the same size.”

If Gertrude had been frightened when she arrived, she was now in a panic of fear.  Her fear was such that it was certitude.  She was not suspicious.  She was convinced.  She looked at Martin in horror, and her heavy limbs shrank under the golden stream as though it were burning her.

“It’s yours,” he laughed.

She burst into tears, and began to moan, “My poor boy, my poor boy!”

He was puzzled for a moment.  Then he divined the cause of her agitation and handed her the Meredith-Lowell letter which had accompanied the check.  She stumbled through it, pausing now and again to wipe her eyes, and when she had finished, said:-

“An’ does it mean that you come by the money honestly?”

“More honestly than if I’d won it in a lottery.  I earned it.”

Slowly faith came back to her, and she reread the letter carefully.  It took him long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which had put the money into his possession, and longer still to get her to understand that the money was really hers and that he did not need it.

“I’ll put it in the bank for you,” she said finally.

“You’ll do nothing of the sort.  It’s yours, to do with as you please, and if you won’t take it, I’ll give it to Maria.  She’ll know what to do with it.  I’d suggest, though, that you hire a servant and take a good long rest.”

“I’m goin’ to tell Bernard all about it,” she announced, when she was leaving.

Martin winced, then grinned.

“Yes, do,” he said.  “And then, maybe, he’ll invite me to dinner again.”

“Yes, he will—I’m sure he will!” she exclaimed fervently, as she drew him to her and kissed and hugged him.

CHAPTER XLII

One day Martin became aware that he was lonely.  He was healthy and strong, and had nothing to do.  The cessation from writing and studying, the death of Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big hole in his life; and his life refused to be pinned down to good living in cafés and the smoking of Egyptian cigarettes.  It was true the South Seas were calling to him, but he had a feeling that the game was not yet played out in the United States.  Two books were soon to be published, and he had more books that might find publication.  Money could be made out of them, and he would wait and take a sackful of it into the South Seas.  He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas that he could buy for a thousand Chili dollars.  The valley ran from the horseshoe, land-locked bay to the tops of the dizzy, cloud-capped peaks and contained perhaps ten thousand acres.  It was filled with tropical fruits, wild chickens, and wild pigs, with an occasional herd of wild cattle, while high up among the peaks were herds of wild goats harried by packs of wild dogs.  The whole place was wild.  Not a human lived in it. And he could buy it and the bay for a thousand Chili dollars.

The bay, as he remembered it, was magnificent, with water deep enough to accommodate the largest vessel afloat, and so safe that the South Pacific Directory recommended it to the best careening place for ships for hundreds of miles around.  He would buy a schooner—one of those yacht-like, coppered crafts that sailed like witches—and go trading copra and pearling among the islands.  He would make the valley and the bay his headquarters.  He would build a patriarchal grass house like Tati’s, and have it and the valley and the schooner filled with dark-skinned servitors.  He would entertain there the factor of Taiohae, captains of wandering traders, and all the best of the South Pacific riffraff.  He would keep open house and entertain like a prince.  And he would forget the books he had opened and the world that had proved an illusion.

To do all this he must wait in California to fill the sack with money.  Already it was beginning to flow in.  If one of the books made a strike, it might enable him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts.  Also he could collect the stories and the poems into books, and make sure of the valley and the bay and the schooner.  He would never write again.  Upon that he was resolved.  But in the meantime, awaiting the publication of the books, he must do something more than live dazed and stupid in the sort of uncaring trance into which he had fallen.

He noted, one Sunday morning, that the Bricklayers’ Picnic took place that day at Shell Mound Park, and to Shell Mound Park he went.  He had been to the working-class picnics too often in his earlier life not to know what they were like, and as he entered the park he experienced a recrudescence of all the old sensations.  After all, they were his kind, these working people.  He had been born among them, he had lived among them, and though he had strayed for a time, it was well to come back among them.

“If it ain’t Mart!” he heard some one say, and the next moment a hearty hand was on his shoulder.  “Where you ben all the time?  Off to sea?  Come on an’ have a drink.”

It was the old crowd in which he found himself—the old crowd, with here and there a gap, and here and there a new face.  The fellows were not bricklayers, but, as in the old days, they attended all Sunday picnics for the dancing, and the fighting, and the fun.  Martin drank with them, and began to feel really human once more.  He was a fool to have ever left them, he thought; and he was very certain that his sum of happiness would have been greater had he remained with them and let alone the books and the people who sat in the high places.  Yet the beer seemed not so good as of yore.  It didn’t taste as it used to taste.  Brissenden had spoiled him for steam beer, he concluded, and wondered if, after all, the books had spoiled him for companionship with these friends of his youth.  He resolved that he would not be so spoiled, and he went on to the dancing pavilion.  Jimmy, the plumber, he met there, in the company of a tall, blond girl who promptly forsook him for Martin.

“Gee, it’s like old times,” Jimmy explained to the gang that gave him the laugh as Martin and the blonde whirled away in a waltz.  “An’ I don’t give a rap.  I’m too damned glad to see ’m back.  Watch ’m waltz, eh?  It’s like silk.  Who’d blame any girl?”

But Martin restored the blonde to Jimmy, and the three of them, with half a dozen friends, watched the revolving couples and laughed and joked with one another.  Everybody was glad to see Martin back.  No book of his been published; he carried no fictitious value in their eyes.  They liked him for himself.  He felt like a prince returned from excile, and his lonely heart burgeoned in the geniality in which it bathed.  He made a mad day of it, and was at his best.  Also, he had money in his pockets, and, as in the old days when he returned from sea with a pay-day, he made the money fly.

Once, on the dancing-floor, he saw Lizzie Connolly go by in the arms of a young workingman; and, later, when he made the round of the pavilion, he came upon her sitting by a refreshment table.  Surprise and greetings over, he led her away into the grounds, where they could talk without shouting down the music.  From the instant he spoke to her, she was his.  He knew it.  She showed it in the proud humility of her eyes, in every caressing movement of her proudly carried body, and in the way she hung upon his speech.  She was not the young girl as he had known her.  She was a woman, now, and Martin noted that her wild, defiant beauty had improved, losing none of its wildness, while the defiance and the fire seemed more in control.  “A beauty, a perfect beauty,” he murmured admiringly under his breath.  And he knew she was his, that all he had to do was to say “Come,” and she would go with him over the world wherever he led.

Even as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy blow on the side of his head that nearly knocked him down.  It was a man’s fist, directed by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had missed the jaw for which it was aimed.  Martin turned as he staggered, and saw the fist coming at him in a wild swing.  Quite as a matter of course he ducked, and the fist flew harmlessly past, pivoting the man who had driven it.  Martin hooked with his left, landing on the pivoting man with the weight of his body behind the blow.  The man went to the ground sidewise, leaped to his feet, and made a mad rush.  Martin saw his passion-distorted face and wondered what could be the cause of the fellow’s anger.  But while he wondered, he shot in a straight left, the weight of his body behind the blow.  The man went over backward and fell in a crumpled heap.  Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward them.

Martin was thrilling all over.  This was the old days with a vengeance, with their dancing, and their fighting, and their fun.  While he kept a wary eye on his antagonist, he glanced at Lizzie.  Usually the girls screamed when the fellows got to scrapping, but she had not screamed.  She was looking on with bated breath, leaning slightly forward, so keen was her interest, one hand pressed to her breast, her cheek flushed, and in her eyes a great and amazed admiration.

The man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the restraining arms that were laid on him.

“She was waitin’ for me to come back!” he was proclaiming to all and sundry.  “She was waitin’ for me to come back, an’ then that fresh guy comes buttin’ in.  Let go o’ me, I tell yeh.  I’m goin’ to fix ’m.”

“What’s eatin’ yer?” Jimmy was demanding, as he helped hold the young fellow back.  “That guy’s Mart Eden.  He’s nifty with his mits, lemme tell you that, an’ he’ll eat you alive if you monkey with ’m.”

“He can’t steal her on me that way,” the other interjected.

“He licked the Flyin’ Dutchman, an’ you know him,” Jimmy went on expostulating.  “An’ he did it in five rounds.  You couldn’t last a minute against him.  See?”

This information seemed to have a mollifying effect, and the irate young man favored Martin with a measuring stare.

“He don’t look it,” he sneered; but the sneer was without passion.

“That’s what the Flyin’ Dutchman thought,” Jimmy assured him.  “Come on, now, let’s get outa this.  There’s lots of other girls.  Come on.”

The young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion, and the gang followed after him.

“Who is he?” Martin asked Lizzie.  “And what’s it all about, anyway?”

Already the zest of combat, which of old had been so keen and lasting, had died down, and he discovered that he was self-analytical, too much so to live, single heart and single hand, so primitive an existence.

Lizzie tossed her head.

“Oh, he’s nobody,” she said.  “He’s just ben keepin’ company with me.”

“I had to, you see,” she explained after a pause.  “I was gettin’ pretty lonesome.  But I never forgot.”  Her voice sank lower, and she looked straight before her.  “I’d throw ’m down for you any time.”

Martin looking at her averted face, knowing that all he had to do was to reach out his hand and pluck her, fell to pondering whether, after all, there was any real worth in refined, grammatical English, and, so, forgot to reply to her.

“You put it all over him,” she said tentatively, with a laugh.

“He’s a husky young fellow, though,” he admitted generously.  “If they hadn’t taken him away, he might have given me my hands full.”

“Who was that lady friend I seen you with that night?” she asked abruptly.

“Oh, just a lady friend,” was his answer.

“It was a long time ago,” she murmured contemplatively.  “It seems like a thousand years.”

But Martin went no further into the matter.  He led the conversation off into other channels.  They had lunch in the restaurant, where he ordered wine and expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with her and with no one but her, till she was tired.  He was a good dancer, and she whirled around and around with him in a heaven of delight, her head against his shoulder, wishing that it could last forever.  Later in the afternoon they strayed off among the trees, where, in the good old fashion, she sat down while he sprawled on his back, his head in her lap.  He lay and dozed, while she fondled his hair, looked down on his closed eyes, and loved him without reserve.  Looking up suddenly, he read the tender advertisement in her face.  Her eyes fluttered down, then they opened and looked into his with soft defiance.

“I’ve kept straight all these years,” she said, her voice so low that it was almost a whisper.

In his heart Martin knew that it was the miraculous truth.  And at his heart pleaded a great temptation.  It was in his power to make her happy.  Denied happiness himself, why should he deny happiness to her?  He could marry her and take her down with him to dwell in the grass-walled castle in the Marquesas.  The desire to do it was strong, but stronger still was the imperative command of his nature not to do it.  In spite of himself he was still faithful to Love.  The old days of license and easy living were gone.  He could not bring them back, nor could he go back to them.  He was changed—how changed he had not realized until now.

“I am not a marrying man, Lizzie,” he said lightly.

The hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly, then went on with the same gentle stroke.  He noticed her face harden, but it was with the hardness of resolution, for still the soft color was in her cheeks and she was all glowing and melting.

“I did not mean that—” she began, then faltered.  “Or anyway I don’t care.”

“I don’t care,” she repeated.  “I’m proud to be your friend.  I’d do anything for you.  I’m made that way, I guess.”

Martin sat up.  He took her hand in his.  He did it deliberately, with warmth but without passion; and such warmth chilled her.

“Don’t let’s talk about it,” she said.

“You are a great and noble woman,” he said.  “And it is I who should be proud to know you.  And I am, I am.  You are a ray of light to me in a very dark world, and I’ve got to be straight with you, just as straight as you have been.”

“I don’t care whether you’re straight with me or not.  You could do anything with me.  You could throw me in the dirt an’ walk on me.  An’ you’re the only man in the world that can,” she added with a defiant flash.  “I ain’t taken care of myself ever since I was a kid for nothin’.”

“And it’s just because of that that I’m not going to,” he said gently.  “You are so big and generous that you challenge me to equal generousness.  I’m not marrying, and I’m not—well, loving without marrying, though I’ve done my share of that in the past.  I’m sorry I came here to-day and met you.  But it can’t be helped now, and I never expected it would turn out this way.”

“But look here, Lizzie.  I can’t begin to tell you how much I like you.  I do more than like you.  I admire and respect you.  You are magnificent, and you are magnificently good.  But what’s the use of words?  Yet there’s something I’d like to do.  You’ve had a hard life; let me make it easy for you.”  (A joyous light welled into her eyes, then faded out again.)  “I’m pretty sure of getting hold of some money soon—lots of it.”

In that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay, the grass-walled castle and the trim, white schooner.  After all, what did it matter?  He could go away, as he had done so often, before the mast, on any ship bound anywhere.

“I’d like to turn it over to you.  There must be something you want—to go to school or business college.  You might like to study and be a stenographer.  I could fix it for you.  Or maybe your father and mother are living—I could set them up in a grocery store or something.  Anything you want, just name it, and I can fix it for you.”

She made no reply, but sat, gazing straight before her, dry-eyed and motionless, but with an ache in the throat which Martin divined so strongly that it made his own throat ache.  He regretted that he had spoken.  It seemed so tawdry what he had offered her—mere money—compared with what she offered him.  He offered her an extraneous thing with which he could part without a pang, while she offered him herself, along with disgrace and shame, and sin, and all her hopes of heaven.

“Don’t let’s talk about it,” she said with a catch in her voice that she changed to a cough.  She stood up.  “Come on, let’s go home.  I’m all tired out.”

The day was done, and the merrymakers had nearly all departed.  But as Martin and Lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang waiting for them.  Martin knew immediately the meaning of it.  Trouble was brewing.  The gang was his body-guard.  They passed out through the gates of the park with, straggling in the rear, a second gang, the friends that Lizzie’s young man had collected to avenge the loss of his lady.  Several constables and special police officers, anticipating trouble, trailed along to prevent it, and herded the two gangs separately aboard the train for San Francisco.  Martin told Jimmy that he would get off at Sixteenth Street Station and catch the electric car into Oakland.  Lizzie was very quiet and without interest in what was impending.  The train pulled in to Sixteenth Street Station, and the waiting electric car could be seen, the conductor of which was impatiently clanging the gong.

“There she is,” Jimmy counselled.  “Make a run for it, an’ we’ll hold ’em back.  Now you go!  Hit her up!”

The hostile gang was temporarily disconcerted by the manoeuvre, then it dashed from the train in pursuit.  The staid and sober Oakland folk who sat upon the car scarcely noted the young fellow and the girl who ran for it and found a seat in front on the outside.  They did not connect the couple with Jimmy, who sprang on the steps, crying to the motorman:-

“Slam on the juice, old man, and beat it outa here!”

The next moment Jimmy whirled about, and the passengers saw him land his fist on the face of a running man who was trying to board the car.  But fists were landing on faces the whole length of the car.  Thus, Jimmy and his gang, strung out on the long, lower steps, met the attacking gang.  The car started with a great clanging of its gong, and, as Jimmy’s gang drove off the last assailants, they, too, jumped off to finish the job.  The car dashed on, leaving the flurry of combat far behind, and its dumfounded passengers never dreamed that the quiet young man and the pretty working-girl sitting in the corner on the outside seat had been the cause of the row.

Martin had enjoyed the fight, with a recrudescence of the old fighting thrills.  But they quickly died away, and he was oppressed by a great sadness.  He felt very old—centuries older than those careless, care-free young companions of his others days.  He had travelled far, too far to go back.  Their mode of life, which had once been his, was now distasteful to him.  He was disappointed in it all.  He had developed into an alien.  As the steam beer had tasted raw, so their companionship seemed raw to him.  He was too far removed.  Too many thousands of opened books yawned between them and him.  He had exiled himself.  He had travelled in the vast realm of intellect until he could no longer return home.  On the other hand, he was human, and his gregarious need for companionship remained unsatisfied.  He had found no new home.  As the gang could not understand him, as his own family could not understand him, as the bourgeoisie could not understand him, so this girl beside him, whom he honored high, could not understand him nor the honor he paid her.  His sadness was not untouched with bitterness as he thought it over.

“Make it up with him,” he advised Lizzie, at parting, as they stood in front of the workingman’s shack in which she lived, near Sixth and Market.  He referred to the young fellow whose place he had usurped that day.

“I can’t—now,” she said.

“Oh, go on,” he said jovially.  “All you have to do is whistle and he’ll come running.”

“I didn’t mean that,” she said simply.

And he knew what she had meant.

She leaned toward him as he was about to say good night.  But she leaned not imperatively, not seductively, but wistfully and humbly.  He was touched to the heart.  His large tolerance rose up in him.  He put his arms around her, and kissed her, and knew that upon his own lips rested as true a kiss as man ever received.

“My God!” she sobbed.  “I could die for you.  I could die for you.”

She tore herself from him suddenly and ran up the steps.  He felt a quick moisture in his eyes.

“Martin Eden,” he communed.  “You’re not a brute, and you’re a damn poor Nietzscheman.  You’d marry her if you could and fill her quivering heart full with happiness.  But you can’t, you can’t.  And it’s a damn shame.”

“‘A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers,’” he muttered, remembering his Henly.  “‘Life is, I think, a blunder and a shame.’  It is—a blunder and a shame.”

CHAPTER XLIII

“The Shame of the Sun” was published in October.  As Martin cut the cords of the express package and the half-dozen complimentary copies from the publishers spilled out on the table, a heavy sadness fell upon him.  He thought of the wild delight that would have been his had this happened a few short months before, and he contrasted that delight that should have been with his present uncaring coldness.  His book, his first book, and his pulse had not gone up a fraction of a beat, and he was only sad.  It meant little to him now.  The most it meant was that it might bring some money, and little enough did he care for money.

He carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to Maria.

“I did it,” he explained, in order to clear up her bewilderment.  “I wrote it in the room there, and I guess some few quarts of your vegetable soup went into the making of it.  Keep it.  It’s yours.  Just to remember me by, you know.”

He was not bragging, not showing off.  His sole motive was to make her happy, to make her proud of him, to justify her long faith in him.  She put the book in the front room on top of the family Bible.  A sacred thing was this book her lodger had made, a fetich of friendship.  It softened the blow of his having been a laundryman, and though she could not understand a line of it, she knew that every line of it was great.  She was a simple, practical, hard-working woman, but she possessed faith in large endowment.

Just as emotionlessly as he had received “The Shame of the Sun” did he read the reviews of it that came in weekly from the clipping bureau.  The book was making a hit, that was evident.  It meant more gold in the money sack.  He could fix up Lizzie, redeem all his promises, and still have enough left to build his grass-walled castle.

Singletree, Darnley & Co. had cautiously brought out an edition of fifteen hundred copies, but the first reviews had started a second edition of twice the size through the presses; and ere this was delivered a third edition of five thousand had been ordered.  A London firm made arrangements by cable for an English edition, and hot-footed upon this came the news of French, German, and Scandinavian translations in progress.  The attack upon the Maeterlinck school could not have been made at a more opportune moment.  A fierce controversy was precipitated.  Saleeby and Haeckel indorsed and defended “The Shame of the Sun,” for once finding themselves on the same side of a question.  Crookes and Wallace ranged up on the opposing side, while Sir Oliver Lodge attempted to formulate a compromise that would jibe with his particular cosmic theories.  Maeterlinck’s followers rallied around the standard of mysticism.  Chesterton set the whole world laughing with a series of alleged non-partisan essays on the subject, and the whole affair, controversy and controversialists, was well-nigh swept into the pit by a thundering broadside from George Bernard Shaw.  Needless to say the arena was crowded with hosts of lesser lights, and the dust and sweat and din became terrific.

“It is a most marvellous happening,” Singletree, Darnley & Co. wrote Martin, “a critical philosophic essay selling like a novel.  You could not have chosen your subject better, and all contributory factors have been unwarrantedly propitious.  We need scarcely to assure you that we are making hay while the sun shines.  Over forty thousand copies have already been sold in the United States and Canada, and a new edition of twenty thousand is on the presses.  We are overworked, trying to supply the demand.  Nevertheless we have helped to create that demand.  We have already spent five thousand dollars in advertising.  The book is bound to be a record-breaker.”

“Please find herewith a contract in duplicate for your next book which we have taken the liberty of forwarding to you.  You will please note that we have increased your royalties to twenty per cent, which is about as high as a conservative publishing house dares go.  If our offer is agreeable to you, please fill in the proper blank space with the title of your book.  We make no stipulations concerning its nature.  Any book on any subject.  If you have one already written, so much the better.  Now is the time to strike.  The iron could not be hotter.”

“On receipt of signed contract we shall be pleased to make you an advance on royalties of five thousand dollars.  You see, we have faith in you, and we are going in on this thing big.  We should like, also, to discuss with you the drawing up of a contract for a term of years, say ten, during which we shall have the exclusive right of publishing in book-form all that you produce.  But more of this anon.”

Martin laid down the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic, finding the product of fifteen cents times sixty thousand to be nine thousand dollars.  He signed the new contract, inserting “The Smoke of Joy” in the blank space, and mailed it back to the publishers along with the twenty storiettes he had written in the days before he discovered the formula for the newspaper storiette.  And promptly as the United States mail could deliver and return, came Singletree, Darnley & Co.’s check for five thousand dollars.

“I want you to come down town with me, Maria, this afternoon about two o’clock,” Martin said, the morning the check arrived.  “Or, better, meet me at Fourteenth and Broadway at two o’clock.  I’ll be looking out for you.”

At the appointed time she was there; but shoes was the only clew to the mystery her mind had been capable of evolving, and she suffered a distinct shock of disappointment when Martin walked her right by a shoe-store and dived into a real estate office.  What happened thereupon resided forever after in her memory as a dream.  Fine gentlemen smiled at her benevolently as they talked with Martin and one another; a type-writer clicked; signatures were affixed to an imposing document; her own landlord was there, too, and affixed his signature; and when all was over and she was outside on the sidewalk, her landlord spoke to her, saying, “Well, Maria, you won’t have to pay me no seven dollars and a half this month.”

Maria was too stunned for speech.

“Or next month, or the next, or the next,” her landlord said.

She thanked him incoherently, as if for a favor.  And it was not until she had returned home to North Oakland and conferred with her own kind, and had the Portuguese grocer investigate, that she really knew that she was the owner of the little house in which she had lived and for which she had paid rent so long.

“Why don’t you trade with me no more?” the Portuguese grocer asked Martin that evening, stepping out to hail him when he got off the car; and Martin explained that he wasn’t doing his own cooking any more, and then went in and had a drink of wine on the house.  He noted it was the best wine the grocer had in stock.

“Maria,” Martin announced that night, “I’m going to leave you.  And you’re going to leave here yourself soon.  Then you can rent the house and be a landlord yourself.  You’ve a brother in San Leandro or Haywards, and he’s in the milk business.  I want you to send all your washing back unwashed—understand?—unwashed, and to go out to San Leandro to-morrow, or Haywards, or wherever it is, and see that brother of yours.  Tell him to come to see me.  I’ll be stopping at the Metropole down in Oakland.  He’ll know a good milk-ranch when he sees one.”

And so it was that Maria became a landlord and the sole owner of a dairy, with two hired men to do the work for her and a bank account that steadily increased despite the fact that her whole brood wore shoes and went to school.  Few persons ever meet the fairy princes they dream about; but Maria, who worked hard and whose head was hard, never dreaming about fairy princes, entertained hers in the guise of an ex-laundryman.

In the meantime the world had begun to ask: “Who is this Martin Eden?”  He had declined to give any biographical data to his publishers, but the newspapers were not to be denied.  Oakland was his own town, and the reporters nosed out scores of individuals who could supply information.  All that he was and was not, all that he had done and most of what he had not done, was spread out for the delectation of the public, accompanied by snapshots and photographs—the latter procured from the local photographer who had once taken Martin’s picture and who promptly copyrighted it and put it on the market.  At first, so great was his disgust with the magazines and all bourgeois society, Martin fought against publicity; but in the end, because it was easier than not to, he surrendered.  He found that he could not refuse himself to the special writers who travelled long distances to see him.  Then again, each day was so many hours long, and, since he no longer was occupied with writing and studying, those hours had to be occupied somehow; so he yielded to what was to him a whim, permitted interviews, gave his opinions on literature and philosophy, and even accepted invitations of the bourgeoisie.  He had settled down into a strange and comfortable state of mind.  He no longer cared.  He forgave everybody, even the cub reporter who had painted him red and to whom he now granted a full page with specially posed photographs.

He saw Lizzie occasionally, and it was patent that she regretted the greatness that had come to him.  It widened the space between them.  Perhaps it was with the hope of narrowing it that she yielded to his persuasions to go to night school and business college and to have herself gowned by a wonderful dressmaker who charged outrageous prices.  She improved visibly from day to day, until Martin wondered if he was doing right, for he knew that all her compliance and endeavor was for his sake.  She was trying to make herself of worth in his eyes—of the sort of worth he seemed to value.  Yet he gave her no hope, treating her in brotherly fashion and rarely seeing her.

“Overdue” was rushed upon the market by the Meredith-Lowell Company in the height of his popularity, and being fiction, in point of sales it made even a bigger strike than “The Shame of the Sun.”  Week after week his was the credit of the unprecedented performance of having two books at the head of the list of best-sellers.  Not only did the story take with the fiction-readers, but those who read “The Shame of the Sun” with avidity were likewise attracted to the sea-story by the cosmic grasp of mastery with which he had handled it.  First he had attacked the literature of mysticism, and had done it exceeding well; and, next, he had successfully supplied the very literature he had exposited, thus proving himself to be that rare genius, a critic and a creator in one.

Money poured in on him, fame poured in on him; he flashed, comet-like, through the world of literature, and he was more amused than interested by the stir he was making.  One thing was puzzling him, a little thing that would have puzzled the world had it known.  But the world would have puzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over the little thing that to him loomed gigantic.  Judge Blount invited him to dinner.  That was the little thing, or the beginning of the little thing, that was soon to become the big thing.  He had insulted Judge Blount, treated him abominably, and Judge Blount, meeting him on the street, invited him to dinner.  Martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on which he had met Judge Blount at the Morses’ and when Judge Blount had not invited him to dinner.  Why had he not invited him to dinner then? he asked himself.  He had not changed.  He was the same Martin Eden.  What made the difference?  The fact that the stuff he had written had appeared inside the covers of books?  But it was work performed.  It was not something he had done since.  It was achievement accomplished at the very time Judge Blount was sharing this general view and sneering at his Spencer and his intellect.  Therefore it was not for any real value, but for a purely fictitious value that Judge Blount invited him to dinner.

Martin grinned and accepted the invitation, marvelling the while at his complacence.  And at the dinner, where, with their womankind, were half a dozen of those that sat in high places, and where Martin found himself quite the lion, Judge Blount, warmly seconded by Judge Hanwell, urged privately that Martin should permit his name to be put up for the Styx—the ultra-select club to which belonged, not the mere men of wealth, but the men of attainment.  And Martin declined, and was more puzzled than ever.

He was kept busy disposing of his heap of manuscripts.  He was overwhelmed by requests from editors.  It had been discovered that he was a stylist, with meat under his style.  The Northern Review, after publishing “The Cradle of Beauty,” had written him for half a dozen similar essays, which would have been supplied out of the heap, had not Burton’s Magazine, in a speculative mood, offered him five hundred dollars each for five essays.  He wrote back that he would supply the demand, but at a thousand dollars an essay.  He remembered that all these manuscripts had been refused by the very magazines that were now clamoring for them.  And their refusals had been cold-blooded, automatic, stereotyped.  They had made him sweat, and now he intended to make them sweat.  Burton’s Magazine paid his price for five essays, and the remaining four, at the same rate, were snapped up by Mackintosh’s Monthly, The Northern Review being too poor to stand the pace.  Thus went out to the world “The High Priests of Mystery,” “The Wonder-Dreamers,” “The Yardstick of the Ego,” “Philosophy of Illusion,” “God and Clod,” “Art and Biology,” “Critics and Test-tubes,” “Star-dust,” and “The Dignity of Usury,”—to raise storms and rumblings and mutterings that were many a day in dying down.

Editors wrote to him telling him to name his own terms, which he did, but it was always for work performed.  He refused resolutely to pledge himself to any new thing.  The thought of again setting pen to paper maddened him.  He had seen Brissenden torn to pieces by the crowd, and despite the fact that him the crowd acclaimed, he could not get over the shock nor gather any respect for the crowd.  His very popularity seemed a disgrace and a treason to Brissenden.  It made him wince, but he made up his mind to go on and fill the money-bag.

He received letters from editors like the following: “About a year ago we were unfortunate enough to refuse your collection of love-poems.  We were greatly impressed by them at the time, but certain arrangements already entered into prevented our taking them.  If you still have them, and if you will be kind enough to forward them, we shall be glad to publish the entire collection on your own terms.  We are also prepared to make a most advantageous offer for bringing them out in book-form.”

Martin recollected his blank-verse tragedy, and sent it instead.  He read it over before mailing, and was particularly impressed by its sophomoric amateurishness and general worthlessness.  But he sent it; and it was published, to the everlasting regret of the editor.  The public was indignant and incredulous.  It was too far a cry from Martin Eden’s high standard to that serious bosh.  It was asserted that he had never written it, that the magazine had faked it very clumsily, or that Martin Eden was emulating the elder Dumas and at the height of success was hiring his writing done for him.  But when he explained that the tragedy was an early effort of his literary childhood, and that the magazine had refused to be happy unless it got it, a great laugh went up at the magazine’s expense and a change in the editorship followed.  The tragedy was never brought out in book-form, though Martin pocketed the advance royalties that had been paid.

Coleman’s Weekly sent Martin a lengthy telegram, costing nearly three hundred dollars, offering him a thousand dollars an article for twenty articles.  He was to travel over the United States, with all expenses paid, and select whatever topics interested him.  The body of the telegram was devoted to hypothetical topics in order to show him the freedom of range that was to be his.  The only restriction placed upon him was that he must confine himself to the United States.  Martin sent his inability to accept and his regrets by wire “collect.”

“Wiki-Wiki,” published in Warren’s Monthly, was an instantaneous success.  It was brought out forward in a wide-margined, beautifully decorated volume that struck the holiday trade and sold like wildfire.  The critics were unanimous in the belief that it would take its place with those two classics by two great writers, “The Bottle Imp” and “The Magic Skin.”

The public, however, received the “Smoke of Joy” collection rather dubiously and coldly.  The audacity and unconventionality of the storiettes was a shock to bourgeois morality and prejudice; but when Paris went mad over the immediate translation that was made, the American and English reading public followed suit and bought so many copies that Martin compelled the conservative house of Singletree, Darnley & Co. to pay a flat royalty of twenty-five per cent for a third book, and thirty per cent flat for a fourth.  These two volumes comprised all the short stories he had written and which had received, or were receiving, serial publication.  “The Ring of Bells” and his horror stories constituted one collection; the other collection was composed of “Adventure,” “The Pot,” “The Wine of Life,” “The Whirlpool,” “The Jostling Street,” and four other stories.  The Lowell-Meredith Company captured the collection of all his essays, and the Maxmillian Company got his “Sea Lyrics” and the “Love-cycle,” the latter receiving serial publication in the Ladies’ Home Companion after the payment of an extortionate price.

Martin heaved a sigh of relief when he had disposed of the last manuscript.  The grass-walled castle and the white, coppered schooner were very near to him.  Well, at any rate he had discovered Brissenden’s contention that nothing of merit found its way into the magazines.  His own success demonstrated that Brissenden had been wrong.

And yet, somehow, he had a feeling that Brissenden had been right, after all.  “The Shame of the Sun” had been the cause of his success more than the stuff he had written.  That stuff had been merely incidental.  It had been rejected right and left by the magazines.  The publication of “The Shame of the Sun” had started a controversy and precipitated the landslide in his favor.  Had there been no “Shame of the Sun” there would have been no landslide, and had there been no miracle in the go of “The Shame of the Sun” there would have been no landslide.  Singletree, Darnley & Co. attested that miracle.  They had brought out a first edition of fifteen hundred copies and been dubious of selling it.  They were experienced publishers and no one had been more astounded than they at the success which had followed.  To them it had been in truth a miracle.  They never got over it, and every letter they wrote him reflected their reverent awe of that first mysterious happening.  They did not attempt to explain it.  There was no explaining it.  It had happened.  In the face of all experience to the contrary, it had happened.

So it was, reasoning thus, that Martin questioned the validity of his popularity.  It was the bourgeoisie that bought his books and poured its gold into his money-sack, and from what little he knew of the bourgeoisie it was not clear to him how it could possibly appreciate or comprehend what he had written.  His intrinsic beauty and power meant nothing to the hundreds of thousands who were acclaiming him and buying his books.  He was the fad of the hour, the adventurer who had stormed Parnassus while the gods nodded.  The hundreds of thousands read him and acclaimed him with the same brute non-understanding with which they had flung themselves on Brissenden’s “Ephemera” and torn it to pieces—a wolf-rabble that fawned on him instead of fanging him.  Fawn or fang, it was all a matter of chance.  One thing he knew with absolute certitude: “Ephemera” was infinitely greater than anything he had done.  It was infinitely greater than anything he had in him.  It was a poem of centuries.  Then the tribute the mob paid him was a sorry tribute indeed, for that same mob had wallowed “Ephemera” into the mire.  He sighed heavily and with satisfaction.  He was glad the last manuscript was sold and that he would soon be done with it all.

CHAPTER XLIV

Mr. Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole.  Whether he had happened there just casually, intent on other affairs, or whether he had come there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner, Martin never could quite make up his mind, though he inclined toward the second hypothesis.  At any rate, invited to dinner he was by Mr. Morse—Ruth’s father, who had forbidden him the house and broken off the engagement.

Martin was not angry.  He was not even on his dignity.  He tolerated Mr. Morse, wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie.  He did not decline the invitation.  Instead, he put it off with vagueness and indefiniteness and inquired after the family, particularly after Mrs. Morse and Ruth.  He spoke her name without hesitancy, naturally, though secretly surprised that he had had no inward quiver, no old, familiar increase of pulse and warm surge of blood.

He had many invitations to dinner, some of which he accepted.  Persons got themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner.  And he went on puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great thing.  Bernard Higginbotham invited him to dinner.  He puzzled the harder.  He remembered the days of his desperate starvation when no one invited him to dinner.  That was the time he needed dinners, and went weak and faint for lack of them and lost weight from sheer famine.  That was the paradox of it.  When he wanted dinners, no one gave them to him, and now that he could buy a hundred thousand dinners and was losing his appetite, dinners were thrust upon him right and left.  But why?  There was no justice in it, no merit on his part.  He was no different.  All the work he had done was even at that time work performed.  Mr. and Mrs. Morse had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through Ruth had urged that he take a clerk’s position in an office.  Furthermore, they had been aware of his work performed.  Manuscript after manuscript of his had been turned over to them by Ruth.  They had read them.  It was the very same work that had put his name in all the papers, and, it was his name being in all the papers that led them to invite him.

One thing was certain: the Morses had not cared to have him for himself or for his work.  Therefore they could not want him now for himself or for his work, but for the fame that was his, because he was somebody amongst men, and—why not?—because he had a hundred thousand dollars or so.  That was the way bourgeois society valued a man, and who was he to expect it otherwise?  But he was proud.  He disdained such valuation.  He desired to be valued for himself, or for his work, which, after all, was an expression of himself.  That was the way Lizzie valued him.  The work, with her, did not even count.  She valued him, himself.  That was the way Jimmy, the plumber, and all the old gang valued him.  That had been proved often enough in the days when he ran with them; it had been proved that Sunday at Shell Mound Park.  His work could go hang.  What they liked, and were willing to scrap for, was just Mart Eden, one of the bunch and a pretty good guy.

Then there was Ruth.  She had liked him for himself, that was indisputable.  And yet, much as she had liked him she had liked the bourgeois standard of valuation more.  She had opposed his writing, and principally, it seemed to him, because it did not earn money.  That had been her criticism of his “Love-cycle.”  She, too, had urged him to get a job.  It was true, she refined it to “position,” but it meant the same thing, and in his own mind the old nomenclature stuck.  He had read her all that he wrote—poems, stories, essays—“Wiki-Wiki,” “The Shame of the Sun,” everything.  And she had always and consistently urged him to get a job, to go to work—good God!—as if he hadn’t been working, robbing sleep, exhausting life, in order to be worthy of her.

So the little thing grew bigger.  He was healthy and normal, ate regularly, slept long hours, and yet the growing little thing was becoming an obsession.  Work performed.  The phrase haunted his brain.  He sat opposite Bernard Higginbotham at a heavy Sunday dinner over Higginbotham’s Cash Store, and it was all he could do to restrain himself from shouting out:-

“It was work performed!  And now you feed me, when then you let me starve, forbade me your house, and damned me because I wouldn’t get a job.  And the work was already done, all done.  And now, when I speak, you check the thought unuttered on your lips and hang on my lips and pay respectful attention to whatever I choose to say.  I tell you your party is rotten and filled with grafters, and instead of flying into a rage you hum and haw and admit there is a great deal in what I say.  And why?  Because I’m famous; because I’ve a lot of money.  Not because I’m Martin Eden, a pretty good fellow and not particularly a fool.  I could tell you the moon is made of green cheese and you would subscribe to the notion, at least you would not repudiate it, because I’ve got dollars, mountains of them.  And it was all done long ago; it was work performed, I tell you, when you spat upon me as the dirt under your feet.”

But Martin did not shout out.  The thought gnawed in his brain, an unceasing torment, while he smiled and succeeded in being tolerant.  As he grew silent, Bernard Higginbotham got the reins and did the talking.  He was a success himself, and proud of it.  He was self-made.  No one had helped him.  He owed no man.  He was fulfilling his duty as a citizen and bringing up a large family.  And there was Higginbotham’s Cash Store, that monument of his own industry and ability.  He loved Higginbotham’s Cash Store as some men loved their wives.  He opened up his heart to Martin, showed with what keenness and with what enormous planning he had made the store.  And he had plans for it, ambitious plans.  The neighborhood was growing up fast.  The store was really too small.  If he had more room, he would be able to put in a score of labor-saving and money-saving improvements.  And he would do it yet.  He was straining every effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up another two-story frame building.  The upstairs he could rent, and the whole ground-floor of both buildings would be Higginbotham’s Cash Store.  His eyes glistened when he spoke of the new sign that would stretch clear across both buildings.

Martin forgot to listen.  The refrain of “Work performed,” in his own brain, was drowning the other’s clatter.  The refrain maddened him, and he tried to escape from it.

“How much did you say it would cost?” he asked suddenly.

His brother-in-law paused in the middle of an expatiation on the business opportunities of the neighborhood.  He hadn’t said how much it would cost.  But he knew.  He had figured it out a score of times.

“At the way lumber is now,” he said, “four thousand could do it.”

“Including the sign?”

“I didn’t count on that.  It’d just have to come, onc’t the buildin’ was there.”

“And the ground?”

“Three thousand more.”

He leaned forward, licking his lips, nervously spreading and closing his fingers, while he watched Martin write a check.  When it was passed over to him, he glanced at the amount-seven thousand dollars.

“I—I can’t afford to pay more than six per cent,” he said huskily.

Martin wanted to laugh, but, instead, demanded:-

“How much would that be?”

“Lemme see.  Six per cent—six times seven—four hundred an’ twenty.”

“That would be thirty-five dollars a month, wouldn’t it?”

Higginbotham nodded.

“Then, if you’ve no objection, well arrange it this way.”  Martin glanced at Gertrude.  “You can have the principal to keep for yourself, if you’ll use the thirty-five dollars a month for cooking and washing and scrubbing.  The seven thousand is yours if you’ll guarantee that Gertrude does no more drudgery.  Is it a go?”

Mr. Higginbotham swallowed hard.  That his wife should do no more housework was an affront to his thrifty soul.  The magnificent present was the coating of a pill, a bitter pill.  That his wife should not work!  It gagged him.

“All right, then,” Martin said.  “I’ll pay the thirty-five a month, and—”

He reached across the table for the check.  But Bernard Higginbotham got his hand on it first, crying:

“I accept!  I accept!”

When Martin got on the electric car, he was very sick and tired.  He looked up at the assertive sign.

“The swine,” he groaned.  “The swine, the swine.”

When Mackintosh’s Magazine published “The Palmist,” featuring it with decorations by Berthier and with two pictures by Wenn, Hermann von Schmidt forgot that he had called the verses obscene.  He announced that his wife had inspired the poem, saw to it that the news reached the ears of a reporter, and submitted to an interview by a staff writer who was accompanied by a staff photographer and a staff artist.  The result was a full page in a Sunday supplement, filled with photographs and idealized drawings of Marian, with many intimate details of Martin Eden and his family, and with the full text of “The Palmist” in large type, and republished by special permission of Mackintosh’s Magazine.  It caused quite a stir in the neighborhood, and good housewives were proud to have the acquaintances of the great writer’s sister, while those who had not made haste to cultivate it.  Hermann von Schmidt chuckled in his little repair shop and decided to order a new lathe.  “Better than advertising,” he told Marian, “and it costs nothing.”

“We’d better have him to dinner,” she suggested.

And to dinner Martin came, making himself agreeable with the fat wholesale butcher and his fatter wife—important folk, they, likely to be of use to a rising young man like Hermann Von Schmidt.  No less a bait, however, had been required to draw them to his house than his great brother-in-law.  Another man at table who had swallowed the same bait was the superintendent of the Pacific Coast agencies for the Asa Bicycle Company.  Him Von Schmidt desired to please and propitiate because from him could be obtained the Oakland agency for the bicycle.  So Hermann von Schmidt found it a goodly asset to have Martin for a brother-in-law, but in his heart of hearts he couldn’t understand where it all came in.  In the silent watches of the night, while his wife slept, he had floundered through Martin’s books and poems, and decided that the world was a fool to buy them.

And in his heart of hearts Martin understood the situation only too well, as he leaned back and gloated at Von Schmidt’s head, in fancy punching it well-nigh off of him, sending blow after blow home just right—the chuckle-headed Dutchman!  One thing he did like about him, however.  Poor as he was, and determined to rise as he was, he nevertheless hired one servant to take the heavy work off of Marian’s hands.  Martin talked with the superintendent of the Asa agencies, and after dinner he drew him aside with Hermann, whom he backed financially for the best bicycle store with fittings in Oakland.  He went further, and in a private talk with Hermann told him to keep his eyes open for an automobile agency and garage, for there was no reason that he should not be able to run both establishments successfully.

With tears in her eyes and her arms around his neck, Marian, at parting, told Martin how much she loved him and always had loved him.  It was true, there was a perceptible halt midway in her assertion, which she glossed over with more tears and kisses and incoherent stammerings, and which Martin inferred to be her appeal for forgiveness for the time she had lacked faith in him and insisted on his getting a job.

“He can’t never keep his money, that’s sure,” Hermann von Schmidt confided to his wife.  “He got mad when I spoke of interest, an’ he said damn the principal and if I mentioned it again, he’d punch my Dutch head off.  That’s what he said—my Dutch head.  But he’s all right, even if he ain’t no business man.  He’s given me my chance, an’ he’s all right.”

Invitations to dinner poured in on Martin; and the more they poured, the more he puzzled.  He sat, the guest of honor, at an Arden Club banquet, with men of note whom he had heard about and read about all his life; and they told him how, when they had read “The Ring of Bells” in the Transcontinental, and “The Peri and the Pearl” in The Hornet, they had immediately picked him for a winner.  My God! and I was hungry and in rags, he thought to himself.  Why didn’t you give me a dinner then?  Then was the time.  It was work performed.  If you are feeding me now for work performed, why did you not feed me then when I needed it?  Not one word in “The Ring of Bells,” nor in “The Peri and the Pearl” has been changed.  No; you’re not feeding me now for work performed.  You are feeding me because everybody else is feeding me and because it is an honor to feed me.  You are feeding me now because you are herd animals; because you are part of the mob; because the one blind, automatic thought in the mob-mind just now is to feed me.  And where does Martin Eden and the work Martin Eden performed come in in all this? he asked himself plaintively, then arose to respond cleverly and wittily to a clever and witty toast.

So it went.  Wherever he happened to be—at the Press Club, at the Redwood Club, at pink teas and literary gatherings—always were remembered “The Ring of Bells” and “The Peri and the Pearl” when they were first published.  And always was Martin’s maddening and unuttered demand: Why didn’t you feed me then?  It was work performed.  “The Ring of Bells” and “The Peri and the Pearl” are not changed one iota.  They were just as artistic, just as worth while, then as now.  But you are not feeding me for their sake, nor for the sake of anything else I have written.  You’re feeding me because it is the style of feeding just now, because the whole mob is crazy with the idea of feeding Martin Eden.

And often, at such times, he would abruptly see slouch in among the company a young hoodlum in square-cut coat and under a stiff-rim Stetson hat.  It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.  As he rose from his chair and stepped forward across the platform, he saw stalk through the wide door at the rear of the great room the young hoodlum with the square-cut coat and stiff-rim hat.  Five hundred fashionably gowned women turned their heads, so intent and steadfast was Martin’s gaze, to see what he was seeing.  But they saw only the empty centre aisle.  He saw the young tough lurching down that aisle and wondered if he would remove the stiff-rim which never yet had he seen him without.  Straight down the aisle he came, and up the platform.  Martin could have wept over that youthful shade of himself, when he thought of all that lay before him.  Across the platform he swaggered, right up to Martin, and into the foreground of Martin’s consciousness disappeared.  The five hundred women applauded softly with gloved hands, seeking to encourage the bashful great man who was their guest.  And Martin shook the vision from his brain, smiled, and began to speak.

The Superintendent of Schools, good old man, stopped Martin on the street and remembered him, recalling seances in his office when Martin was expelled from school for fighting.

“I read your ‘Ring of Bells’ in one of the magazines quite a time ago,” he said.  “It was as good as Poe.  Splendid, I said at the time, splendid!”

Yes, and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street and did not know me, Martin almost said aloud.  Each time I was hungry and heading for the pawnbroker.  Yet it was work performed.  You did not know me then.  Why do you know me now?

“I was remarking to my wife only the other day,” the other was saying, “wouldn’t it be a good idea to have you out to dinner some time?  And she quite agreed with me.  Yes, she quite agreed with me.”

“Dinner?” Martin said so sharply that it was almost a snarl.

“Why, yes, yes, dinner, you know—just pot luck with us, with your old superintendent, you rascal,” he uttered nervously, poking Martin in an attempt at jocular fellowship.

Martin went down the street in a daze.  He stopped at the corner and looked about him vacantly.

“Well, I’ll be damned!” he murmured at last.  “The old fellow was afraid of me.”

CHAPTER XLV

Kreis came to Martin one day—Kreis, of the “real dirt”; and Martin turned to him with relief, to receive the glowing details of a scheme sufficiently wild-catty to interest him as a fictionist rather than an investor.  Kreis paused long enough in the midst of his exposition to tell him that in most of his “Shame of the Sun” he had been a chump.

“But I didn’t come here to spout philosophy,” Kreis went on.  “What I want to know is whether or not you will put a thousand dollars in on this deal?”

“No, I’m not chump enough for that, at any rate,” Martin answered.  “But I’ll tell you what I will do.  You gave me the greatest night of my life.  You gave me what money cannot buy.  Now I’ve got money, and it means nothing to me.  I’d like to turn over to you a thousand dollars of what I don’t value for what you gave me that night and which was beyond price.  You need the money.  I’ve got more than I need.  You want it.  You came for it.  There’s no use scheming it out of me.  Take it.”

Kreis betrayed no surprise.  He folded the check away in his pocket.

“At that rate I’d like the contract of providing you with many such nights,” he said.

“Too late.”  Martin shook his head.  “That night was the one night for me.  I was in paradise.  It’s commonplace with you, I know.  But it wasn’t to me.  I shall never live at such a pitch again.  I’m done with philosophy.  I want never to hear another word of it.”

“The first dollar I ever made in my life out of my philosophy,” Kreis remarked, as he paused in the doorway.  “And then the market broke.”

Mrs. Morse drove by Martin on the street one day, and smiled and nodded.  He smiled back and lifted his hat.  The episode did not affect him.  A month before it might have disgusted him, or made him curious and set him to speculating about her state of consciousness at that moment.  But now it was not provocative of a second thought.  He forgot about it the next moment.  He forgot about it as he would have forgotten the Central Bank Building or the City Hall after having walked past them.  Yet his mind was preternaturally active.  His thoughts went ever around and around in a circle.  The centre of that circle was “work performed”; it ate at his brain like a deathless maggot.  He awoke to it in the morning.  It tormented his dreams at night.  Every affair of life around him that penetrated through his senses immediately related itself to “work performed.”  He drove along the path of relentless logic to the conclusion that he was nobody, nothing.  Mart Eden, the hoodlum, and Mart Eden, the sailor, had been real, had been he; but Martin Eden! the famous writer, did not exist.  Martin Eden, the famous writer, was a vapor that had arisen in the mob-mind and by the mob-mind had been thrust into the corporeal being of Mart Eden, the hoodlum and sailor.  But it couldn’t fool him.  He was not that sun-myth that the mob was worshipping and sacrificing dinners to.  He knew better.

He read the magazines about himself, and pored over portraits of himself published therein until he was unable to associate his identity with those portraits.  He was the fellow who had lived and thrilled and loved; who had been easy-going and tolerant of the frailties of life; who had served in the forecastle, wandered in strange lands, and led his gang in the old fighting days.  He was the fellow who had been stunned at first by the thousands of books in the free library, and who had afterward learned his way among them and mastered them; he was the fellow who had burned the midnight oil and bedded with a spur and written books himself.  But the one thing he was not was that colossal appetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding.

There were things, however, in the magazines that amused him.  All the magazines were claiming him.  Warren’s Monthly advertised to its subscribers that it was always on the quest after new writers, and that, among others, it had introduced Martin Eden to the reading public.  The White Mouse claimed him; so did The Northern Review and Mackintosh’s Magazine, until silenced by The Globe, which pointed triumphantly to its files where the mangled “Sea Lyrics” lay buried.  Youth and Age, which had come to life again after having escaped paying its bills, put in a prior claim, which nobody but farmers’ children ever read.  The Transcontinental made a dignified and convincing statement of how it first discovered Martin Eden, which was warmly disputed by The Hornet, with the exhibit of “The Peri and the Pearl.”  The modest claim of Singletree, Darnley & Co. was lost in the din.  Besides, that publishing firm did not own a magazine wherewith to make its claim less modest.

The newspapers calculated Martin’s royalties.  In some way the magnificent offers certain magazines had made him leaked out, and Oakland ministers called upon him in a friendly way, while professional begging letters began to clutter his mail.  But worse than all this were the women.  His photographs were published broadcast, and special writers exploited his strong, bronzed face, his scars, his heavy shoulders, his clear, quiet eyes, and the slight hollows in his cheeks like an ascetic’s.  At this last he remembered his wild youth and smiled.  Often, among the women he met, he would see now one, now another, looking at him, appraising him, selecting him.  He laughed to himself.  He remembered Brissenden’s warning and laughed again.  The women would never destroy him, that much was certain.  He had gone past that stage.

Once, walking with Lizzie toward night school, she caught a glance directed toward him by a well-gowned, handsome woman of the bourgeoisie.  The glance was a trifle too long, a shade too considerative.  Lizzie knew it for what it was, and her body tensed angrily.  Martin noticed, noticed the cause of it, told her how used he was becoming to it and that he did not care anyway.

“You ought to care,” she answered with blazing eyes.  “You’re sick.  That’s what’s the matter.”

“Never healthier in my life.  I weigh five pounds more than I ever did.”

“It ain’t your body.  It’s your head.  Something’s wrong with your think-machine.  Even I can see that, an’ I ain’t nobody.”

He walked on beside her, reflecting.

“I’d give anything to see you get over it,” she broke out impulsively.  “You ought to care when women look at you that way, a man like you.  It’s not natural.  It’s all right enough for sissy-boys.  But you ain’t made that way.  So help me, I’d be willing an’ glad if the right woman came along an’ made you care.”

When he left Lizzie at night school, he returned to the Metropole.

Once in his rooms, he dropped into a Morris chair and sat staring straight before him.  He did not doze.  Nor did he think.  His mind was a blank, save for the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form and color and radiance just under his eyelids.  He saw these pictures, but he was scarcely conscious of them—no more so than if they had been dreams.  Yet he was not asleep.  Once, he roused himself and glanced at his watch.  It was just eight o’clock.  He had nothing to do, and it was too early for bed.  Then his mind went blank again, and the pictures began to form and vanish under his eyelids.  There was nothing distinctive about the pictures.  They were always masses of leaves and shrub-like branches shot through with hot sunshine.

A knock at the door aroused him.  He was not asleep, and his mind immediately connected the knock with a telegram, or letter, or perhaps one of the servants bringing back clean clothes from the laundry.  He was thinking about Joe and wondering where he was, as he said, “Come in.”

He was still thinking about Joe, and did not turn toward the door.  He heard it close softly.  There was a long silence.  He forgot that there had been a knock at the door, and was still staring blankly before him when he heard a woman’s sob.  It was involuntary, spasmodic, checked, and stifled—he noted that as he turned about.  The next instant he was on his feet.

“Ruth!” he said, amazed and bewildered.

Her face was white and strained.  She stood just inside the door, one hand against it for support, the other pressed to her side.  She extended both hands toward him piteously, and started forward to meet him.  As he caught her hands and led her to the Morris chair he noticed how cold they were.  He drew up another chair and sat down on the broad arm of it.  He was too confused to speak.  In his own mind his affair with Ruth was closed and sealed.  He felt much in the same way that he would have felt had the Shelly Hot Springs Laundry suddenly invaded the Hotel Metropole with a whole week’s washing ready for him to pitch into.  Several times he was about to speak, and each time he hesitated.

“No one knows I am here,” Ruth said in a faint voice, with an appealing smile.

“What did you say?”

He was surprised at the sound of his own voice.

She repeated her words.

“Oh,” he said, then wondered what more he could possibly say.

“I saw you come in, and I waited a few minutes.”

“Oh,” he said again.

He had never been so tongue-tied in his life.  Positively he did not have an idea in his head.  He felt stupid and awkward, but for the life of him he could think of nothing to say.  It would have been easier had the intrusion been the Shelly Hot Springs laundry.  He could have rolled up his sleeves and gone to work.

“And then you came in,” he said finally.

She nodded, with a slightly arch expression, and loosened the scarf at her throat.

“I saw you first from across the street when you were with that girl.”

“Oh, yes,” he said simply.  “I took her down to night school.”

“Well, aren’t you glad to see me?” she said at the end of another silence.

“Yes, yes.”  He spoke hastily.  “But wasn’t it rash of you to come here?”

“I slipped in.  Nobody knows I am here.  I wanted to see you.  I came to tell you I have been very foolish.  I came because I could no longer stay away, because my heart compelled me to come, because—because I wanted to come.”

She came forward, out of her chair and over to him.  She rested her hand on his shoulder a moment, breathing quickly, and then slipped into his arms.  And in his large, easy way, desirous of not inflicting hurt, knowing that to repulse this proffer of herself was to inflict the most grievous hurt a woman could receive, he folded his arms around her and held her close.  But there was no warmth in the embrace, no caress in the contact.  She had come into his arms, and he held her, that was all.  She nestled against him, and then, with a change of position, her hands crept up and rested upon his neck.  But his flesh was not fire beneath those hands, and he felt awkward and uncomfortable.

“What makes you tremble so?” he asked.  “Is it a chill?  Shall I light the grate?”

He made a movement to disengage himself, but she clung more closely to him, shivering violently.

“It is merely nervousness,” she said with chattering teeth.  “I’ll control myself in a minute.  There, I am better already.”

Slowly her shivering died away.  He continued to hold her, but he was no longer puzzled.  He knew now for what she had come.

“My mother wanted me to marry Charley Hapgood,” she announced.

“Charley Hapgood, that fellow who speaks always in platitudes?” Martin groaned.  Then he added, “And now, I suppose, your mother wants you to marry me.”

He did not put it in the form of a question.  He stated it as a certitude, and before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures of his royalties.

“She will not object, I know that much,” Ruth said.

“She considers me quite eligible?”

Ruth nodded.

“And yet I am not a bit more eligible now than I was when she broke our engagement,” he meditated.  “I haven’t changed any.  I’m the same Martin Eden, though for that matter I’m a bit worse—I smoke now.  Don’t you smell my breath?”

In reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips, placed them graciously and playfully, and in expectancy of the kiss that of old had always been a consequence.  But there was no caressing answer of Martin’s lips.  He waited until the fingers were removed and then went on.

“I am not changed.  I haven’t got a job.  I’m not looking for a job.  Furthermore, I am not going to look for a job.  And I still believe that Herbert Spencer is a great and noble man and that Judge Blount is an unmitigated ass.  I had dinner with him the other night, so I ought to know.”

“But you didn’t accept father’s invitation,” she chided.

“So you know about that?  Who sent him?  Your mother?”

She remained silent.

“Then she did send him.  I thought so.  And now I suppose she has sent you.”

“No one knows that I am here,” she protested.  “Do you think my mother would permit this?”

“She’d permit you to marry me, that’s certain.”

She gave a sharp cry.  “Oh, Martin, don’t be cruel.  You have not kissed me once.  You are as unresponsive as a stone.  And think what I have dared to do.”  She looked about her with a shiver, though half the look was curiosity.  “Just think of where I am.”

“I could die for you!  I could die for you!”—Lizzie’s words were ringing in his ears.

“Why didn’t you dare it before?” he asked harshly.  “When I hadn’t a job?  When I was starving?  When I was just as I am now, as a man, as an artist, the same Martin Eden?  That’s the question I’ve been propounding to myself for many a day—not concerning you merely, but concerning everybody.  You see I have not changed, though my sudden apparent appreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that point.  I’ve got the same flesh on my bones, the same ten fingers and toes.  I am the same.  I have not developed any new strength nor virtue.  My brain is the same old brain.  I haven’t made even one new generalization on literature or philosophy.  I am personally of the same value that I was when nobody wanted me.  And what is puzzling me is why they want me now.  Surely they don’t want me for myself, for myself is the same old self they did not want.  Then they must want me for something else, for something that is outside of me, for something that is not I!  Shall I tell you what that something is?  It is for the recognition I have received.  That recognition is not I.  It resides in the minds of others.  Then again for the money I have earned and am earning.  But that money is not I.  It resides in banks and in the pockets of Tom, Dick, and Harry.  And is it for that, for the recognition and the money, that you now want me?”

“You are breaking my heart,” she sobbed.  “You know I love you, that I am here because I love you.”

“I am afraid you don’t see my point,” he said gently.  “What I mean is: if you love me, how does it happen that you love me now so much more than you did when your love was weak enough to deny me?”

“Forget and forgive,” she cried passionately.  “I loved you all the time, remember that, and I am here, now, in your arms.”

“I’m afraid I am a shrewd merchant, peering into the scales, trying to weigh your love and find out what manner of thing it is.”

She withdrew herself from his arms, sat upright, and looked at him long and searchingly.  She was about to speak, then faltered and changed her mind.

“You see, it appears this way to me,” he went on.  “When I was all that I am now, nobody out of my own class seemed to care for me.  When my books were all written, no one who had read the manuscripts seemed to care for them.  In point of fact, because of the stuff I had written they seemed to care even less for me.  In writing the stuff it seemed that I had committed acts that were, to say the least, derogatory.  ‘Get a job,’ everybody said.”

She made a movement of dissent.

“Yes, yes,” he said; “except in your case you told me to get a position.  The homely word job, like much that I have written, offends you.  It is brutal.  But I assure you it was no less brutal to me when everybody I knew recommended it to me as they would recommend right conduct to an immoral creature.  But to return.  The publication of what I had written, and the public notice I received, wrought a change in the fibre of your love.  Martin Eden, with his work all performed, you would not marry.  Your love for him was not strong enough to enable you to marry him.  But your love is now strong enough, and I cannot avoid the conclusion that its strength arises from the publication and the public notice.  In your case I do not mention royalties, though I am certain that they apply to the change wrought in your mother and father.  Of course, all this is not flattering to me.  But worst of all, it makes me question love, sacred love.  Is love so gross a thing that it must feed upon publication and public notice?  It would seem so.  I have sat and thought upon it till my head went around.”

“Poor, dear head.”  She reached up a hand and passed the fingers soothingly through his hair.  “Let it go around no more.  Let us begin anew, now.  I loved you all the time.  I know that I was weak in yielding to my mother’s will.  I should not have done so.  Yet I have heard you speak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of humankind.  Extend that charity to me.  I acted mistakenly.  Forgive me.”

“Oh, I do forgive,” he said impatiently.  “It is easy to forgive where there is really nothing to forgive.  Nothing that you have done requires forgiveness.  One acts according to one’s lights, and more than that one cannot do.  As well might I ask you to forgive me for my not getting a job.”

“I meant well,” she protested.  “You know that I could not have loved you and not meant well.”

“True; but you would have destroyed me out of your well-meaning.”

“Yes, yes,” he shut off her attempted objection.  “You would have destroyed my writing and my career.  Realism is imperative to my nature, and the bourgeois spirit hates realism.  The bourgeoisie is cowardly.  It is afraid of life.  And all your effort was to make me afraid of life.  You would have formalized me.  You would have compressed me into a two-by-four pigeonhole of life, where all life’s values are unreal, and false, and vulgar.”  He felt her stir protestingly.  “Vulgarity—a hearty vulgarity, I’ll admit—is the basis of bourgeois refinement and culture.  As I say, you wanted to formalize me, to make me over into one of your own class, with your class-ideals, class-values, and class-prejudices.”  He shook his head sadly.  “And you do not understand, even now, what I am saying.  My words do not mean to you what I endeavor to make them mean.  What I say is so much fantasy to you.  Yet to me it is vital reality.  At the best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw boy, crawling up out of the mire of the abyss, should pass judgment upon your class and call it vulgar.”

She leaned her head wearily against his shoulder, and her body shivered with recurrent nervousness.  He waited for a time for her to speak, and then went on.

“And now you want to renew our love.  You want us to be married.  You want me.  And yet, listen—if my books had not been noticed, I’d nevertheless have been just what I am now.  And you would have stayed away.  It is all those damned books—”

“Don’t swear,” she interrupted.

Her reproof startled him.  He broke into a harsh laugh.

“That’s it,” he said, “at a high moment, when what seems your life’s happiness is at stake, you are afraid of life in the same old way—afraid of life and a healthy oath.”

She was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her act, and yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was consequently resentful.  They sat in silence for a long time, she thinking desperately and he pondering upon his love which had departed.  He knew, now, that he had not really loved her.  It was an idealized Ruth he had loved, an ethereal creature of his own creating, the bright and luminous spirit of his love-poems.  The real bourgeois Ruth, with all the bourgeois failings and with the hopeless cramp of the bourgeois psychology in her mind, he had never loved.

She suddenly began to speak.

“I know that much you have said is so.  I have been afraid of life.  I did not love you well enough.  I have learned to love better.  I love you for what you are, for what you were, for the ways even by which you have become.  I love you for the ways wherein you differ from what you call my class, for your beliefs which I do not understand but which I know I can come to understand.  I shall devote myself to understanding them.  And even your smoking and your swearing—they are part of you and I will love you for them, too.  I can still learn.  In the last ten minutes I have learned much.  That I have dared to come here is a token of what I have already learned.  Oh, Martin!—”

She was sobbing and nestling close against him.

For the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy, and she acknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face.

“It is too late,” he said.  He remembered Lizzie’s words.  “I am a sick man—oh, not my body.  It is my soul, my brain.  I seem to have lost all values.  I care for nothing.  If you had been this way a few months ago, it would have been different.  It is too late, now.”

“It is not too late,” she cried.  “I will show you.  I will prove to you that my love has grown, that it is greater to me than my class and all that is dearest to me.  All that is dearest to the bourgeoisie I will flout.  I am no longer afraid of life.  I will leave my father and mother, and let my name become a by-word with my friends.  I will come to you here and now, in free love if you will, and I will be proud and glad to be with you.  If I have been a traitor to love, I will now, for love’s sake, be a traitor to all that made that earlier treason.”

She stood before him, with shining eyes.

“I am waiting, Martin,” she whispered, “waiting for you to accept me.  Look at me.”

It was splendid, he thought, looking at her.  She had redeemed herself for all that she had lacked, rising up at last, true woman, superior to the iron rule of bourgeois convention.  It was splendid, magnificent, desperate.  And yet, what was the matter with him?  He was not thrilled nor stirred by what she had done.  It was splendid and magnificent only intellectually.  In what should have been a moment of fire, he coldly appraised her.  His heart was untouched.  He was unaware of any desire for her.  Again he remembered Lizzie’s words.

“I am sick, very sick,” he said with a despairing gesture.  “How sick I did not know till now.  Something has gone out of me.  I have always been unafraid of life, but I never dreamed of being sated with life.  Life has so filled me that I am empty of any desire for anything.  If there were room, I should want you, now.  You see how sick I am.”

He leaned his head back and closed his eyes; and like a child, crying, that forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the tear-dimmed films over the pupils, so Martin forgot his sickness, the presence of Ruth, everything, in watching the masses of vegetation, shot through hotly with sunshine that took form and blazed against this background of his eyelids.  It was not restful, that green foliage.  The sunlight was too raw and glaring.  It hurt him to look at it, and yet he looked, he knew not why.

He was brought back to himself by the rattle of the door-knob.  Ruth was at the door.

“How shall I get out?” she questioned tearfully.  “I am afraid.”

“Oh, forgive me,” he cried, springing to his feet.  “I’m not myself, you know.  I forgot you were here.”  He put his hand to his head.  “You see, I’m not just right.  I’ll take you home.  We can go out by the servants’ entrance.  No one will see us.  Pull down that veil and everything will be all right.”

She clung to his arm through the dim-lighted passages and down the narrow stairs.

“I am safe now,” she said, when they emerged on the sidewalk, at the same time starting to take her hand from his arm.

“No, no, I’ll see you home,” he answered.

“No, please don’t,” she objected.  “It is unnecessary.”

Again she started to remove her hand.  He felt a momentary curiosity.  Now that she was out of danger she was afraid.  She was in almost a panic to be quit of him.  He could see no reason for it and attributed it to her nervousness.  So he restrained her withdrawing hand and started to walk on with her.  Halfway down the block, he saw a man in a long overcoat shrink back into a doorway.  He shot a glance in as he passed by, and, despite the high turned-up collar, he was certain that he recognized Ruth’s brother, Norman.

During the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation.  She was stunned.  He was apathetic.  Once, he mentioned that he was going away, back to the South Seas, and, once, she asked him to forgive her having come to him.  And that was all.  The parting at her door was conventional.  They shook hands, said good night, and he lifted his hat.  The door swung shut, and he lighted a cigarette and turned back for his hotel.  When he came to the doorway into which he had seen Norman shrink, he stopped and looked in in a speculative humor.

“She lied,” he said aloud.  “She made believe to me that she had dared greatly, and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was waiting to take her back.”  He burst into laughter.  “Oh, these bourgeois!  When I was broke, I was not fit to be seen with his sister.  When I have a bank account, he brings her to me.”

As he swung on his heel to go on, a tramp, going in the same direction, begged him over his shoulder.

“Say, mister, can you give me a quarter to get a bed?” were the words.

But it was the voice that made Martin turn around.  The next instant he had Joe by the hand.

“D’ye remember that time we parted at the Hot Springs?” the other was saying.  “I said then we’d meet again.  I felt it in my bones.  An’ here we are.”

“You’re looking good,” Martin said admiringly, “and you’ve put on weight.”

“I sure have.”  Joe’s face was beaming.  “I never knew what it was to live till I hit hoboin’.  I’m thirty pounds heavier an’ feel tiptop all the time.  Why, I was worked to skin an’ bone in them old days.  Hoboin’ sure agrees with me.”

“But you’re looking for a bed just the same,” Martin chided, “and it’s a cold night.”

“Huh?  Lookin’ for a bed?”  Joe shot a hand into his hip pocket and brought it out filled with small change.  “That beats hard graft,” he exulted.  “You just looked good; that’s why I battered you.”

Martin laughed and gave in.

“You’ve several full-sized drunks right there,” he insinuated.

Joe slid the money back into his pocket.

“Not in mine,” he announced.  “No gettin’ oryide for me, though there ain’t nothin’ to stop me except I don’t want to.  I’ve ben drunk once since I seen you last, an’ then it was unexpected, bein’ on an empty stomach.  When I work like a beast, I drink like a beast.  When I live like a man, I drink like a man—a jolt now an’ again when I feel like it, an’ that’s all.”

Martin arranged to meet him next day, and went on to the hotel.  He paused in the office to look up steamer sailings.  The Mariposa sailed for Tahiti in five days.

“Telephone over to-morrow and reserve a stateroom for me,” he told the clerk.  “No deck-stateroom, but down below, on the weather-side,—the port-side, remember that, the port-side.  You’d better write it down.”

Once in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently as a child.  The occurrences of the evening had made no impression on him.  His mind was dead to impressions.  The glow of warmth with which he met Joe had been most fleeting.  The succeeding minute he had been bothered by the ex-laundryman’s presence and by the compulsion of conversation.  That in five more days he sailed for his loved South Seas meant nothing to him.  So he closed his eyes and slept normally and comfortably for eight uninterrupted hours.  He was not restless.  He did not change his position, nor did he dream.  Sleep had become to him oblivion, and each day that he awoke, he awoke with regret.  Life worried and bored him, and time was a vexation.

CHAPTER XLVI

“Say, Joe,” was his greeting to his old-time working-mate next morning, “there’s a Frenchman out on Twenty-eighth Street.  He’s made a pot of money, and he’s going back to France.  It’s a dandy, well-appointed, small steam laundry.  There’s a start for you if you want to settle down.  Here, take this; buy some clothes with it and be at this man’s office by ten o’clock.  He looked up the laundry for me, and he’ll take you out and show you around.  If you like it, and think it is worth the price—twelve thousand—let me know and it is yours.  Now run along.  I’m busy.  I’ll see you later.”

“Now look here, Mart,” the other said slowly, with kindling anger, “I come here this mornin’ to see you.  Savve?  I didn’t come here to get no laundry.  I come a here for a talk for old friends’ sake, and you shove a laundry at me.  I tell you, what you can do.  You can take that laundry an’ go to hell.”

He was out of the room when Martin caught him and whirled him around.

“Now look here, Joe,” he said; “if you act that way, I’ll punch your head.  An for old friends’ sake I’ll punch it hard.  Savve?—you will, will you?”

Joe had clinched and attempted to throw him, and he was twisting and writhing out of the advantage of the other’s hold.  They reeled about the room, locked in each other’s arms, and came down with a crash across the splintered wreckage of a wicker chair.  Joe was underneath, with arms spread out and held and with Martin’s knee on his chest.  He was panting and gasping for breath when Martin released him.

“Now we’ll talk a moment,” Martin said.  “You can’t get fresh with me.  I want that laundry business finished first of all.  Then you can come back and we’ll talk for old sake’s sake.  I told you I was busy.  Look at that.”

A servant had just come in with the morning mail, a great mass of letters and magazines.

“How can I wade through that and talk with you?  You go and fix up that laundry, and then we’ll get together.”

“All right,” Joe admitted reluctantly.  “I thought you was turnin’ me down, but I guess I was mistaken.  But you can’t lick me, Mart, in a stand-up fight.  I’ve got the reach on you.”

“We’ll put on the gloves sometime and see,” Martin said with a smile.

“Sure; as soon as I get that laundry going.”  Joe extended his arm.  “You see that reach?  It’ll make you go a few.”

Martin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the laundryman.  He was becoming anti-social.  Daily he found it a severer strain to be decent with people.  Their presence perturbed him, and the effort of conversation irritated him.  They made him restless, and no sooner was he in contact with them than he was casting about for excuses to get rid of them.

He did not proceed to attack his mail, and for a half hour he lolled in his chair, doing nothing, while no more than vague, half-formed thoughts occasionally filtered through his intelligence, or rather, at wide intervals, themselves constituted the flickering of his intelligence.

He roused himself and began glancing through his mail.  There were a dozen requests for autographs—he knew them at sight; there were professional begging letters; and there were letters from cranks, ranging from the man with a working model of perpetual motion, and the man who demonstrated that the surface of the earth was the inside of a hollow sphere, to the man seeking financial aid to purchase the Peninsula of Lower California for the purpose of communist colonization.  There were letters from women seeking to know him, and over one such he smiled, for enclosed was her receipt for pew-rent, sent as evidence of her good faith and as proof of her respectability.

Editors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters, the former on their knees for his manuscripts, the latter on their knees for his books—his poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all he possessed in pawn for so many dreary months in order to find them in postage.  There were unexpected checks for English serial rights and for advance payments on foreign translations.  His English agent announced the sale of German translation rights in three of his books, and informed him that Swedish editions, from which he could expect nothing because Sweden was not a party to the Berne Convention, were already on the market.  Then there was a nominal request for his permission for a Russian translation, that country being likewise outside the Berne Convention.

He turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from his press bureau, and read about himself and his vogue, which had become a furore.  All his creative output had been flung to the public in one magnificent sweep.  That seemed to account for it.  He had taken the public off its feet, the way Kipling had, that time when he lay near to death and all the mob, animated by a mob-mind thought, began suddenly to read him.  Martin remembered how that same world-mob, having read him and acclaimed him and not understood him in the least, had, abruptly, a few months later, flung itself upon him and torn him to pieces.  Martin grinned at the thought.  Who was he that he should not be similarly treated in a few more months?  Well, he would fool the mob.  He would be away, in the South Seas, building his grass house, trading for pearls and copra, jumping reefs in frail outriggers, catching sharks and bonitas, hunting wild goats among the cliffs of the valley that lay next to the valley of Taiohae.

In the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation dawned upon him.  He saw, cleared eyed, that he was in the Valley of the Shadow.  All the life that was in him was fading, fainting, making toward death.

He realized how much he slept, and how much he desired to sleep.  Of old, he had hated sleep.  It had robbed him of precious moments of living.  Four hours of sleep in the twenty-four had meant being robbed of four hours of life.  How he had grudged sleep!  Now it was life he grudged.  Life was not good; its taste in his mouth was without tang, and bitter.  This was his peril.  Life that did not yearn toward life was in fair way toward ceasing.  Some remote instinct for preservation stirred in him, and he knew he must get away.  He glanced about the room, and the thought of packing was burdensome.  Perhaps it would be better to leave that to the last.  In the meantime he might be getting an outfit.

He put on his hat and went out, stopping in at a gun-store, where he spent the remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles, ammunition, and fishing tackle.  Fashions changed in trading, and he knew he would have to wait till he reached Tahiti before ordering his trade-goods.  They could come up from Australia, anyway.  This solution was a source of pleasure.  He had avoided doing something, and the doing of anything just now was unpleasant.  He went back to the hotel gladly, with a feeling of satisfaction in that the comfortable Morris chair was waiting for him; and he groaned inwardly, on entering his room, at sight of Joe in the Morris chair.

Joe was delighted with the laundry.  Everything was settled, and he would enter into possession next day.  Martin lay on the bed, with closed eyes, while the other talked on.  Martin’s thoughts were far away—so far away that he was rarely aware that he was thinking.  It was only by an effort that he occasionally responded.  And yet this was Joe, whom he had always liked.  But Joe was too keen with life.  The boisterous impact of it on Martin’s jaded mind was a hurt.  It was an aching probe to his tired sensitiveness.  When Joe reminded him that sometime in the future they were going to put on the gloves together, he could almost have screamed.

“Remember, Joe, you’re to run the laundry according to those old rules you used to lay down at Shelly Hot Springs,” he said.  “No overworking.  No working at night.  And no children at the mangles.  No children anywhere.  And a fair wage.”

Joe nodded and pulled out a note-book.

“Look at here.  I was workin’ out them rules before breakfast this A.M.  What d’ye think of them?”

He read them aloud, and Martin approved, worrying at the same time as to when Joe would take himself off.

It was late afternoon when he awoke.  Slowly the fact of life came back to him.  He glanced about the room.  Joe had evidently stolen away after he had dozed off.  That was considerate of Joe, he thought.  Then he closed his eyes and slept again.

In the days that followed Joe was too busy organizing and taking hold of the laundry to bother him much; and it was not until the day before sailing that the newspapers made the announcement that he had taken passage on the Mariposa.  Once, when the instinct of preservation fluttered, he went to a doctor and underwent a searching physical examination.  Nothing could be found the matter with him.  His heart and lungs were pronounced magnificent.  Every organ, so far as the doctor could know, was normal and was working normally.

“There is nothing the matter with you, Mr. Eden,” he said, “positively nothing the matter with you.  You are in the pink of condition.  Candidly, I envy you your health.  It is superb.  Look at that chest.  There, and in your stomach, lies the secret of your remarkable constitution.  Physically, you are a man in a thousand—in ten thousand.  Barring accidents, you should live to be a hundred.”

And Martin knew that Lizzie’s diagnosis had been correct.  Physically he was all right.  It was his “think-machine” that had gone wrong, and there was no cure for that except to get away to the South Seas.  The trouble was that now, on the verge of departure, he had no desire to go.  The South Seas charmed him no more than did bourgeois civilization.  There was no zest in the thought of departure, while the act of departure appalled him as a weariness of the flesh.  He would have felt better if he were already on board and gone.

The last day was a sore trial.  Having read of his sailing in the morning papers, Bernard Higginbotham, Gertrude, and all the family came to say good-by, as did Hermann von Schmidt and Marian.  Then there was business to be transacted, bills to be paid, and everlasting reporters to be endured.  He said good-by to Lizzie Connolly, abruptly, at the entrance to night school, and hurried away.  At the hotel he found Joe, too busy all day with the laundry to have come to him earlier.  It was the last straw, but Martin gripped the arms of his chair and talked and listened for half an hour.

“You know, Joe,” he said, “that you are not tied down to that laundry.  There are no strings on it.  You can sell it any time and blow the money.  Any time you get sick of it and want to hit the road, just pull out.  Do what will make you the happiest.”

Joe shook his head.

“No more road in mine, thank you kindly.  Hoboin’s all right, exceptin’ for one thing—the girls.  I can’t help it, but I’m a ladies’ man.  I can’t get along without ’em, and you’ve got to get along without ’em when you’re hoboin’.  The times I’ve passed by houses where dances an’ parties was goin’ on, an’ heard the women laugh, an’ saw their white dresses and smiling faces through the windows—Gee!  I tell you them moments was plain hell.  I like dancin’ an’ picnics, an’ walking in the moonlight, an’ all the rest too well.  Me for the laundry, and a good front, with big iron dollars clinkin’ in my jeans.  I seen a girl already, just yesterday, and, d’ye know, I’m feelin’ already I’d just as soon marry her as not.  I’ve ben whistlin’ all day at the thought of it.  She’s a beaut, with the kindest eyes and softest voice you ever heard.  Me for her, you can stack on that.  Say, why don’t you get married with all this money to burn?  You could get the finest girl in the land.”

Martin shook his head with a smile, but in his secret heart he was wondering why any man wanted to marry.  It seemed an amazing and incomprehensible thing.

From the deck of the Mariposa, at the sailing hour, he saw Lizzie Connolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf.  Take her with you, came the thought.  It is easy to be kind.  She will be supremely happy.  It was almost a temptation one moment, and the succeeding moment it became a terror.  He was in a panic at the thought of it.  His tired soul cried out in protest.  He turned away from the rail with a groan, muttering, “Man, you are too sick, you are too sick.”

He fled to his stateroom, where he lurked until the steamer was clear of the dock.  In the dining saloon, at luncheon, he found himself in the place of honor, at the captain’s right; and he was not long in discovering that he was the great man on board.  But no more unsatisfactory great man ever sailed on a ship.  He spent the afternoon in a deck-chair, with closed eyes, dozing brokenly most of the time, and in the evening went early to bed.

After the second day, recovered from seasickness, the full passenger list was in evidence, and the more he saw of the passengers the more he disliked them.  Yet he knew that he did them injustice.  They were good and kindly people, he forced himself to acknowledge, and in the moment of acknowledgment he qualified—good and kindly like all the bourgeoisie, with all the psychological cramp and intellectual futility of their kind, they bored him when they talked with him, their little superficial minds were so filled with emptiness; while the boisterous high spirits and the excessive energy of the younger people shocked him.  They were never quiet, ceaselessly playing deck-quoits, tossing rings, promenading, or rushing to the rail with loud cries to watch the leaping porpoises and the first schools of flying fish.

He slept much.  After breakfast he sought his deck-chair with a magazine he never finished.  The printed pages tired him.  He puzzled that men found so much to write about, and, puzzling, dozed in his chair.  When the gong awoke him for luncheon, he was irritated that he must awaken.  There was no satisfaction in being awake.

Once, he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy, and went forward into the forecastle with the sailors.  But the breed of sailors seemed to have changed since the days he had lived in the forecastle.  He could find no kinship with these stolid-faced, ox-minded bestial creatures.  He was in despair.  Up above nobody had wanted Martin Eden for his own sake, and he could not go back to those of his own class who had wanted him in the past.  He did not want them.  He could not stand them any more than he could stand the stupid first-cabin passengers and the riotous young people.

Life was to him like strong, white light that hurts the tired eyes of a sick person.  During every conscious moment life blazed in a raw glare around him and upon him.  It hurt.  It hurt intolerably.  It was the first time in his life that Martin had travelled first class.  On ships at sea he had always been in the forecastle, the steerage, or in the black depths of the coal-hold, passing coal.  In those days, climbing up the iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat, he had often caught glimpses of the passengers, in cool white, doing nothing but enjoy themselves, under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from them, with subservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim, and it had seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their being was nothing else than paradise.  Well, here he was, the great man on board, in the midmost centre of it, sitting at the captain’s right hand, and yet vainly harking back to forecastle and stoke-hole in quest of the Paradise he had lost.  He had found no new one, and now he could not find the old one.

He strove to stir himself and find something to interest him.  He ventured the petty officers’ mess, and was glad to get away.  He talked with a quartermaster off duty, an intelligent man who promptly prodded him with the socialist propaganda and forced into his hands a bunch of leaflets and pamphlets.  He listened to the man expounding the slave-morality, and as he listened, he thought languidly of his own Nietzsche philosophy.  But what was it worth, after all?  He remembered one of Nietzsche’s mad utterances wherein that madman had doubted truth.  And who was to say?  Perhaps Nietzsche had been right.  Perhaps there was no truth in anything, no truth in truth—no such thing as truth.  But his mind wearied quickly, and he was content to go back to his chair and doze.

Miserable as he was on the steamer, a new misery came upon him.  What when the steamer reached Tahiti?  He would have to go ashore.  He would have to order his trade-goods, to find a passage on a schooner to the Marquesas, to do a thousand and one things that were awful to contemplate.  Whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think, he could see the desperate peril in which he stood.  In all truth, he was in the Valley of the Shadow, and his danger lay in that he was not afraid.  If he were only afraid, he would make toward life.  Being unafraid, he was drifting deeper into the shadow.  He found no delight in the old familiar things of life.  The Mariposa was now in the northeast trades, and this wine of wind, surging against him, irritated him.  He had his chair moved to escape the embrace of this lusty comrade of old days and nights.

The day the Mariposa entered the doldrums, Martin was more miserable than ever.  He could no longer sleep.  He was soaked with sleep, and perforce he must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life.  He moved about restlessly.  The air was sticky and humid, and the rain-squalls were unrefreshing.  He ached with life.  He walked around the deck until that hurt too much, then sat in his chair until he was compelled to walk again.  He forced himself at last to finish the magazine, and from the steamer library he culled several volumes of poetry.  But they could not hold him, and once more he took to walking.

He stayed late on deck, after dinner, but that did not help him, for when he went below, he could not sleep.  This surcease from life had failed him.  It was too much.  He turned on the electric light and tried to read.  One of the volumes was a Swinburne.  He lay in bed, glancing through its pages, until suddenly he became aware that he was reading with interest.  He finished the stanza, attempted to read on, then came back to it.  He rested the book face downward on his breast and fell to thinking.  That was it.  The very thing.  Strange that it had never come to him before.  That was the meaning of it all; he had been drifting that way all the time, and now Swinburne showed him that it was the happy way out.  He wanted rest, and here was rest awaiting him.  He glanced at the open port-hole.  Yes, it was large enough.  For the first time in weeks he felt happy.  At last he had discovered the cure of his ill.  He picked up the book and read the stanza slowly aloud:-

“‘From too much love of living,
From hope and fear set free,
We thank with brief thanksgiving
Whatever gods may be
That no life lives forever;
That dead men rise up never;
That even the weariest river
Winds somewhere safe to sea.’”

He looked again at the open port.  Swinburne had furnished the key.  Life was ill, or, rather, it had become ill—an unbearable thing.  “That dead men rise up never!”  That line stirred him with a profound feeling of gratitude.  It was the one beneficent thing in the universe.  When life became an aching weariness, death was ready to soothe away to everlasting sleep.  But what was he waiting for?  It was time to go.

He arose and thrust his head out the port-hole, looking down into the milky wash.  The Mariposa was deeply loaded, and, hanging by his hands, his feet would be in the water.  He could slip in noiselessly.  No one would hear.  A smother of spray dashed up, wetting his face.  It tasted salt on his lips, and the taste was good.  He wondered if he ought to write a swan-song, but laughed the thought away.  There was no time.  He was too impatient to be gone.

Turning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him, he went out the port-hole feet first.  His shoulders stuck, and he forced himself back so as to try it with one arm down by his side.  A roll of the steamer aided him, and he was through, hanging by his hands.  When his feet touched the sea, he let go.  He was in a milky froth of water.  The side of the Mariposa rushed past him like a dark wall, broken here and there by lighted ports.  She was certainly making time.  Almost before he knew it, he was astern, swimming gently on the foam-crackling surface.

A bonita struck at his white body, and he laughed aloud.  It had taken a piece out, and the sting of it reminded him of why he was there.  In the work to do he had forgotten the purpose of it.  The lights of the Mariposa were growing dim in the distance, and there he was, swimming confidently, as though it were his intention to make for the nearest land a thousand miles or so away.

It was the automatic instinct to live.  He ceased swimming, but the moment he felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck out sharply with a lifting movement.  The will to live, was his thought, and the thought was accompanied by a sneer.  Well, he had will,—ay, will strong enough that with one last exertion it could destroy itself and cease to be.

He changed his position to a vertical one.  He glanced up at the quiet stars, at the same time emptying his lungs of air.  With swift, vigorous propulsion of hands and feet, he lifted his shoulders and half his chest out of water.  This was to gain impetus for the descent.  Then he let himself go and sank without movement, a white statue, into the sea.  He breathed in the water deeply, deliberately, after the manner of a man taking an anaesthetic.  When he strangled, quite involuntarily his arms and legs clawed the water and drove him up to the surface and into the clear sight of the stars.

The will to live, he thought disdainfully, vainly endeavoring not to breathe the air into his bursting lungs.  Well, he would have to try a new way.  He filled his lungs with air, filled them full.  This supply would take him far down.  He turned over and went down head first, swimming with all his strength and all his will.  Deeper and deeper he went.  His eyes were open, and he watched the ghostly, phosphorescent trails of the darting bonita.  As he swam, he hoped that they would not strike at him, for it might snap the tension of his will.  But they did not strike, and he found time to be grateful for this last kindness of life.

Down, down, he swam till his arms and leg grew tired and hardly moved.  He knew that he was deep.  The pressure on his ear-drums was a pain, and there was a buzzing in his head.  His endurance was faltering, but he compelled his arms and legs to drive him deeper until his will snapped and the air drove from his lungs in a great explosive rush.  The bubbles rubbed and bounded like tiny balloons against his cheeks and eyes as they took their upward flight.  Then came pain and strangulation.  This hurt was not death, was the thought that oscillated through his reeling consciousness.  Death did not hurt.  It was life, the pangs of life, this awful, suffocating feeling; it was the last blow life could deal him.

His wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about, spasmodically and feebly.  But he had fooled them and the will to live that made them beat and churn.  He was too deep down.  They could never bring him to the surface.  He seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision.  Colors and radiances surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him.  What was that?  It seemed a lighthouse; but it was inside his brain—a flashing, bright white light.  It flashed swifter and swifter.  There was a long rumble of sound, and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast and interminable stairway.  And somewhere at the bottom he fell into darkness.  That much he knew.  He had fallen into darkness.  And at the instant he knew, he ceased to know.



CHAPTER I

[3] The studio was filled with the rich odor of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as usual, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-colored blossoms of the laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters who, in an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the black-crocketed spires of the early June hollyhocks, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive, and the dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.

As he looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing [4] his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.

"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry, languidly. "You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. The Grosvenor is the only place."

"I don't think I will send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. "No: I won't send it anywhere."

Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette. "Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion."

"I know you will laugh at me," he replied, "but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."

Lord Henry stretched his long legs out on the divan and shook with laughter.

"Yes, I knew you would laugh; but it is quite true, all the same."

"Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself an exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and consequently he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is a brainless, beautiful thing, who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him."

"You don't understand me, Harry. Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that [5] seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit quietly and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live, undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are,--my fame, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks,--we will all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly."

"Dorian Gray? is that his name?" said Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward.

"Yes; that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you."

"But why not?"

"Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely I never tell their names to any one. It seems like surrendering a part of them. You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can make modern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?"

"Not at all," answered Lord Henry, laying his hand upon his shoulder; "not at all, my dear Basil. You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. When we meet,--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the duke's,--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces. My wife is very good at it,--much better, in fact, than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me."

"I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry," said Basil Hallward, shaking his hand off, and strolling towards the door that led into the garden. "I believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a pose."

"Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know," cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together, and for a time they did not speak.

After a long pause Lord Henry pulled out his watch. "I am afraid I must be going, Basil," he murmured, "and before I go I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago."

"What is that?" asked Basil Hallward, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.

"You know quite well."

"I do not, Harry."

[6] "Well, I will tell you what it is."

"Please don't."

"I must. I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason."

"I told you the real reason."

"No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it. Now, that is childish."

"Harry," said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, "every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown with it the secret of my own soul."

Lord Harry laughed. "And what is that?" he asked.

"I will tell you," said Hallward; and an expression of perplexity came over his face.

"I am all expectation, Basil," murmured his companion, looking at him.

"Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry," answered the young painter; "and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly believe it."

Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass, and examined it. "I am quite sure I shall understand it," he replied, gazing intently at the little golden white-feathered disk, "and I can believe anything, provided that it is incredible."

The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup in the grass, and a long thin dragon-fly floated by on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and he wondered what was coming.

"Well, this is incredible," repeated Hallward, rather bitterly,--"incredible to me at times. I don't know what it means. The story is simply this. Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor painters have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious Academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me. I turned half-way round, and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious instinct of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. My father destined me for the army. I insisted on [7] going to Oxford. Then he made me enter my name at the Middle Temple. Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up the Bar, and announced my intention of becoming a painter. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then--But I don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I knew that if I spoke to Dorian I would become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought not to speak to him. I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that made me do so: it was cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape."

"Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all."

"I don't believe that, Harry. However, whatever was my motive,--and it may have been pride, for I used to be very proud,--I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon. 'You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out. You know her shrill horrid voice?"

"Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty," said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with his long, nervous fingers.

"I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to Royalties, and people with Stars and Garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and hooked noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again. It was mad of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him. Perhaps it was not so mad, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other."

"And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man? I know she goes in for giving a rapid précis of all her guests. I remember her bringing me up to a most truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, something like 'Sir Humpty Dumpty--you know--Afghan frontier--Russian intrigues: very successful man--wife killed by an elephant--quite inconsolable--wants to marry a beautiful American widow--everybody does nowadays--hates Mr. Gladstone--but very much interested in beetles: ask him what he thinks of Schouvaloff.' I simply fled. I like to find out people for myself. But poor Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know. But what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"

[8] "Oh, she murmured, 'Charming boy--poor dear mother and I quite inseparable--engaged to be married to the same man--I mean married on the same day--how very silly of me! Quite forget what he does--afraid he--doesn't do anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?' We could neither of us help laughing, and we became friends at once."

"Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best ending for one," said Lord Henry, plucking another daisy.

Hallward buried his face in his hands. "You don't understand what friendship is, Harry," he murmured,--"or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one."

"How horribly unjust of you!" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back, and looking up at the little clouds that were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk. "Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their characters, and my enemies for their brains. A man can't be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain."

"I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance."

"My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance."

"And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?"

"Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else."

"Harry!"

"My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can't help detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that we can't stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper classes. They feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the Divorce Court, their indignation was quite magnificent. And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the lower orders live correctly."

"I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, Harry, I don't believe you do either."

Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard, and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled malacca cane. "How English you are, Basil! If one puts forward an idea to a real Englishman,--always a rash thing to do,--he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it one's self. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it [9] will not be colored by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don't propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons better than principles. Tell me more about Dorian Gray. How often do you see him?"

"Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day. Of course sometimes it is only for a few minutes. But a few minutes with somebody one worships mean a great deal."

"But you don't really worship him?"

"I do."

"How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but your painting,--your art, I should say. Art sounds better, doesn't it?"

"He is all my art to me now. I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the history of the world. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinoüs was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, model from him. Of course I have done all that. He has stood as Paris in dainty armor, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms, he has sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, looking into the green, turbid Nile. He has leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the water's silent silver the wonder of his own beauty. But he is much more to me than that. I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done since I met Dorian Gray is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way--I wonder will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now re-create life in a way that was hidden from me before. 'A dream of form in days of thought,'--who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad,--for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty,--his merely visible presence,--ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in itself all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body,--how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is bestial, an ideality that is void. Harry! Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price, but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me."

"Basil, this is quite wonderful! I must see Dorian Gray." Hallward got up from the seat, and walked up and down the [10] garden. After some time he came back. "You don't understand, Harry," he said. "Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there. He is simply a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I see him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and the subtleties of certain colors. That is all."

"Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?"

"Because I have put into it all the extraordinary romance of which, of course, I have never dared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He will never know anything about it. But the world might guess it; and I will not bare my soul to their shallow, prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry,--too much of myself!"

"Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions."

"I hate them for it. An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. If I live, I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray."

"I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?"

Hallward considered for a few moments. "He likes me," he answered, after a pause; "I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said. I give myself away. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we walk home together from the club arm in arm, or sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day."

"Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger. Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well informed man,--that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-à-brac shop, all monsters and dust, and everything priced above its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day you will look at Gray, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of color, or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be [11] perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will alter you. The worst of having a romance is that it leaves one so unromantic."

"Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can't feel what I feel. You change too often."

"Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are faithful know only the pleasures of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies." And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case, and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and self-satisfied air, as if he had summed up life in a phrase. There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends,--those were the fascinating things in life. He thought with pleasure of the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been sure to meet Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the housing of the poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to Hallward, and said, "My dear fellow, I have just remembered."

"Remembered what, Harry?"

"Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray."

"Where was it?" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.

"Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt's, Lady Agatha's. She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man, who was going to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation of good looks. At least, good women have not. She said that he was very earnest, and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horridly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend."

"I am very glad you didn't, Harry."

"Why?"

"I don't want you to meet him."

"Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir," said the butler, coming into the garden.

"You must introduce me now," cried Lord Henry, laughing.

Basil Hallward turned to the servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight. "Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I will be in in a few moments." The man bowed, and went up the walk.

Then he looked at Lord Henry. "Dorian Gray is my dearest friend," he said. "He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him. Don't spoil him for me. Don't try to influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Don't take [12] away from me the one person that makes life absolutely lovely to me, and that gives to my art whatever wonder or charm it possesses. Mind, Harry, I trust you." He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.

"What nonsense you talk!" said Lord Henry, smiling, and, taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.




CHAPTER II

[...12] As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann's "Forest Scenes." "You must lend me these, Basil," he cried. "I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming."

"That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian."

"Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized portrait of myself," answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool, in a wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush colored his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. "I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had any one with you."

"This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you have spoiled everything."

"You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray," said Lord Henry, stepping forward and shaking him by the hand. "My aunt has often spoken to me about you. You are one of her favorites, and, I am afraid, one of her victims also."

"I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present," answered Dorian, with a funny look of penitence. "I promised to go to her club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to have played a duet together,--three duets, I believe. I don't know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call."

"Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you. And I don't think it really matters about your not being there. The audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people."

"That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me," answered Dorian, laughing.

Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his finely-curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at once. All the candor of youth was there, as well as all youth's passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him. He was made to be worshipped.

"You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray,--far too charming." And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan, and opened his cigarette-case.

Hallward had been busy mixing his colors and getting his brushes ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry's last [13] remark he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?"

Lord Henry smiled, and looked at Dorian Gray. "Am I to go, Mr. Gray?" he asked.

"Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods; and I can't bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy."

"I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. But I certainly will not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don't really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to."

Hallward bit his lip. "If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay. Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself."

Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. "You are very pressing, Basil, but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans.--Good-by, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street. I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me when you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you."

"Basil," cried Dorian Gray, "if Lord Henry goes I shall go too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask him to stay. I insist upon it."

"Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me," said Hallward, gazing intently at his picture. "It is quite true, I never talk when I am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay."

"But what about my man at the Orleans?"

Hallward laughed. "I don't think there will be any difficulty about that. Sit down again, Harry.--And now, Dorian, get up on the platform, and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the exception of myself."

Dorian stepped up on the dais, with the air of a young Greek martyr, and made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Hallward. They made a delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few moments he said to him, "Have you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry? As bad as Basil says?"

"There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral,--immoral from the scientific point of view."

"Why?"

"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly,--that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's [14] self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion,--these are the two things that govern us. And yet--"

"Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy," said Hallward, deep in his work, and conscious only that a look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen there before.

"And yet," continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, "I believe that if one man were to live his life out fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream,--I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal,--to something finer, richer, than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man among us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame--"

"Stop!" murmured Dorian Gray, "stop! you bewilder me. I don't know what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don't speak. Let me think, or, rather, let me try not to think."

For nearly ten minutes he stood there motionless, with parted lips, and eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh impulses were at work within him, and they seemed to him to have come really from himself. The few words that Basil's friend had said to him--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them--had yet touched some secret chord, that had never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.

Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather a new chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! [15] They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?

Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-colored to him. It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known it?

Lord Henry watched him, with his sad smile. He knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested. He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through the same experience. He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How fascinating the lad was!

Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that come only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.

"Basil, I am tired of standing," cried Dorian Gray, suddenly. "I must go out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here."

"My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can't think of anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And I have caught the effect I wanted,--the half-parted lips, and the bright look in the eyes. I don't know what Harry has been saying to you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose he has been paying you compliments. You mustn't believe a word that he says."

"He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the reason I don't think I believe anything he has told me."

"You know you believe it all," said Lord Henry, looking at him with his dreamy, heavy-lidded eyes. "I will go out to the garden with you. It is horridly hot in the studio.--Basil, let us have something iced to drink, something with strawberries in it."

"Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I will join you later on. Don't keep Dorian too long. I have never been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands."

Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him, and put his hand upon his shoulder. "You are quite right to do that," he murmured. "Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul."

The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. His finely-chiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.

[16] "Yes," continued Lord Henry, "that is one of the great secrets of life,--to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul. You are a wonderful creature. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know."

Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic olive-colored face and worn expression interested him. There was something in his low, languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flower-like hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between then had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery. And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He was not a school-boy, or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.

"Let us go and sit in the shade," said Lord Henry. "Parker has brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare you will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must not let yourself become sunburnt. It would be very unbecoming to you."

"What does it matter?" cried Dorian, laughing, as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden.

"It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray."

"Why?"

"Because you have now the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth having."

"I don't feel that, Lord Henry."

"No, you don't feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so?

"You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don't frown. You have. And Beauty is a form of Genius,--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation. It is one of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won't smile.

"People say sometimes that Beauty is only superficial. That may be so. But at least it is not so superficial as Thought. To me, Beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.

"Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which really to live. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left [17] for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly.

"Realize your youth while you have it. Don't squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar, which are the aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.

"A new hedonism,--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.

"The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, what you really might be. There was so much about you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last,--such a little time.

"The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as golden next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will have its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty, becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we did not dare to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!"

Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the fretted purple of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion, for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time it flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.

Suddenly Hallward appeared at the door of the studio, and made frantic signs for them to come in. They turned to each other, and smiled.

"I am waiting," cried Hallward. "Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and you can bring your drinks."

They rose up, and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the end of the garden a thrush began to sing.

"You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray," said Lord Henry, looking at him.

"Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?"

[18] "Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer."

As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry's arm. "In that case, let our friendship be a caprice," he murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped upon the platform and resumed his pose.

Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair, and watched him. The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness, except when Hallward stepped back now and then to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that streamed through the open door-way the dust danced and was golden. The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.

After about a quarter of an hour, Hallward stopped painting, looked for a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes, and smiling. "It is quite finished," he cried, at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in thin vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.

Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.

"My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly," he said.--"Mr. Gray, come and look at yourself."

The lad started, as if awakened from some dream. "Is it really finished?" he murmured, stepping down from the platform.

"Quite finished," said Hallward. "And you have sat splendidly to-day. I am awfully obliged to you."

"That is entirely due to me," broke in Lord Henry. "Isn't it, Mr. Gray?"

Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there motionless, and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before. Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggerations of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had come Lord Henry, with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and colorless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet would pass away from his lips, and the gold steal from his hair. The life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become ignoble, hideous, and uncouth.

[19] As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck like a knife across him, and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes deepened into amethyst, and a mist of tears came across them. He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.

"Don't you like it?" cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the lad's silence, and not understanding what it meant.

"Of course he likes it," said Lord Henry. "Who wouldn't like it? It is one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you like to ask for it. I must have it."

"It is not my property, Harry."

"Whose property is it?"

"Dorian's, of course."

"He is a very lucky fellow."

"How sad it is!" murmured Dorian Gray, with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait. "How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrid, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June. . . . If it was only the other way! If it was I who were to be always young, and the picture that were to grow old! For this--for this--I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!"

"You would hardly care for that arrangement, Basil," cried Lord Henry, laughing. "It would be rather hard lines on you."

"I should object very strongly, Harry."

Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. "I believe you would, Basil. You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say."

Hallward stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like that. What had happened? He seemed almost angry. His face was flushed and his cheeks burning.

"Yes," he continued, "I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry is perfectly right. Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I will kill myself."

Hallward turned pale, and caught his hand. "Dorian! Dorian!" he cried, "don't talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things, are you?"

"I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me, and gives something to it. Oh, if it was only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day,--mock me horribly!" The hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as if he was praying.

"This is your doing, Harry," said Hallward, bitterly.

[20] "My doing?"

"Yes, yours, and you know it."

Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "It is the real Dorian Gray,--that is all," he answered.

"It is not."

"If it is not, what have I to do with it?"

"You should have gone away when I asked you."

"I stayed when you asked me."

"Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and color? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them."

Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and looked at him with pallid face and tear-stained eyes, as he walked over to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the large curtained window. What was he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at last. He was going to rip up the canvas.

With a stifled sob he leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the studio. "Don't, Basil, don't!" he cried. "It would be murder!"

"I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian," said Hallward, coldly, when he had recovered from his surprise. "I never thought you would."

"Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself, I feel that."

"Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself." And he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea. "You will have tea, of course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Tea is the only simple pleasure left to us."

"I don't like simple pleasures," said Lord Henry. "And I don't like scenes, except on the stage. What absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after all: though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn't really want it, and I do."

"If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I will never forgive you!" cried Dorian Gray. "And I don't allow people to call me a silly boy."

"You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it existed."

"And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you don't really mind being called a boy."

"I should have minded very much this morning, Lord Henry."

"Ah! this morning! You have lived since then."

There came a knock to the door, and the butler entered with the tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a [21] rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn. Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray went over and poured the tea out. The two men sauntered languidly to the table, and examined what was under the covers.

"Let us go to the theatre to-night," said Lord Henry. "There is sure to be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White's, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire and say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have the surprise of candor."

"It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes," muttered Hallward. "And, when one has them on, they are so horrid."

"Yes," answered Lord Henry, dreamily, "the costume of our day is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only color-element left in modern life."

"You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry."

"Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one in the picture?"

"Before either."

"I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry," said the lad.

"Then you shall come; and you will come too, Basil, won't you?"

"I can't, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do."

"Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray."

"I should like that awfully."

Basil Hallward bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture. "I will stay with the real Dorian," he said, sadly.

"Is it the real Dorian?" cried the original of the portrait, running across to him. "Am I really like that?"

"Yes; you are just like that."

"How wonderful, Basil!"

"At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter," said Hallward. "That is something."

"What a fuss people make about fidelity!" murmured Lord Henry.

"And, after all, it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. It is either an unfortunate accident, or an unpleasant result of temperament. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say."

"Don't go to the theatre to-night, Dorian," said Hallward. "Stop and dine with me."

"I can't, really."

"Why?"

"Because I have promised Lord Henry to go with him."

"He won't like you better for keeping your promises. He always breaks his own. I beg you not to go."

Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.

"I entreat you."

The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea-table with an amused smile.

[22] "I must go, Basil," he answered.

"Very well," said Hallward; and he walked over and laid his cup down on the tray. "It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better lose no time. Good-by, Harry; good-by, Dorian. Come and see me soon. Come to-morrow."

"Certainly."

"You won't forget?"

"No, of course not."

"And . . . Harry!"

"Yes, Basil?"

"Remember what I asked you, when in the garden this morning."

"I have forgotten it."

"I trust you."

"I wish I could trust myself," said Lord Henry, laughing.--"Come, Mr. Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.--Good-by, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon."

As the door closed behind them, Hallward flung himself down on a sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.




CHAPTER III

[...22] One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Curzon Street. It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-colored frieze and ceiling of raised plaster-work, and its brick-dust felt carpet strewn with long-fringed silk Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of "Les Cent Nouvelles," bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve, and powdered with the gilt daisies that the queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars, filled with parrot-tulips, were ranged on the mantel-shelf, and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-colored light of a summer's day in London.

Lord Henry had not come in yet. He was always late on principle, his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately-illustrated edition of "Manon Lescaut" that he had found in one of the bookcases. The formal monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going away.

At last he heard a light step outside, and the door opened. "How late you are, Harry!" he murmured.

"I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray," said a woman's voice.

He glanced quickly round, and rose to his feet. "I beg your pardon. I thought--"

"You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my husband has got twenty-seven of them."

[23] "Not twenty-seven, Lady Henry?"

"Well, twenty-six, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the Opera." She laughed nervously, as she spoke, and watched him with her vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest. She was always in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.

"That was at 'Lohengrin,' Lady Henry, I think?"

"Yes; it was at dear 'Lohengrin.' I like Wagner's music better than any other music. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time, without people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage: don't you think so, Mr. Gray?"

The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her fingers began to play with a long paper-knife.

Dorian smiled, and shook his head: "I am afraid I don't think so, Lady Henry. I never talk during music,--at least during good music. If one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it by conversation."

"Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray? But you must not think I don't like good music. I adore it, but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped pianists,--two at a time, sometimes. I don't know what it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are, aren't they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time, don't they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it? You have never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one's rooms look so picturesque. But here is Harry!--Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something,--I forget what it was,--and I found Mr. Gray here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same views. No; I think our views are quite different. But he has been most pleasant. I am so glad I've seen him."

"I am charmed, my love, quite charmed," said Lord Henry, elevating his dark crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile.--"So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street, and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays people know the price of everything, and the value of nothing."

"I am afraid I must be going," exclaimed Lady Henry, after an awkward silence, with her silly sudden laugh. "I have promised to drive with the duchess.--Good-by, Mr. Gray.--Good-by, Harry. You are dining out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury's."

"I dare say, my dear," said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her, as she flitted out of the room, looking like a bird-of-paradise that had been out in the rain, and leaving a faint odor of patchouli behind her. Then he shook hands with Dorian Gray, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on the sofa.

[24] "Never marry a woman with straw-colored hair, Dorian," he said, after a few puffs.

"Why, Harry?"

"Because they are so sentimental."

"But I like sentimental people."

"Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed."

"I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do everything you say."

"Whom are you in love with?" said Lord Henry, looking at him with a curious smile.

"With an actress," said Dorian Gray, blushing.

Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "That is a rather common-place début," he murmured.

"You would not say so if you saw her, Harry."

"Who is she?"

"Her name is Sibyl Vane."

"Never heard of her."

"No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius."

"My dear boy, no woman is a genius: women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. They represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as we men represent the triumph of mind over morals. There are only two kinds of women, the plain and the colored. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake, however. They paint in order to try to look young. Our grandmothers painted in order to try to talk brilliantly. Rouge and esprit used to go together. That has all gone out now. As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and two of these can't be admitted into decent society. However, tell me about your genius. How long have you known her?"

"About three weeks. Not so much. About two weeks and two days."

"How did you come across her?"

"I will tell you, Harry; but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it. After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in the Park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who passed me, and wonder with a mad curiosity what sort of lives they led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations.

"One evening about seven o'clock I determined to go out in search of some adventure. I felt that this gray, monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its splendid sinners, and its sordid sins, as [25] you once said, must have something in store for me. I fancied a thousand things.

"The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful night when we first dined together, about the search for beauty being the poisonous secret of life. I don't know what I expected, but I went out, and wandered eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black, grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by a little third-rate theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ''Ave a box, my lord?' he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an act of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the present day I can't make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn't!--my dear Harry, if I hadn't, I would have missed the greatest romance of my life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!"

"I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love. There are exquisite things in store for you. This is merely the beginning."

"Do you think my nature so shallow?" cried Dorian Gray, angrily.

"No; I think your nature so deep."

"How do you mean?"

"My dear boy, people who only love once in their lives are really shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or the lack of imagination. Faithlessness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the intellectual life,--simply a confession of failure. But I don't want to interrupt you. Go on with your story."

"Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out behind the curtain, and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on."

"It must have been just like the palmy days of the British Drama."

"Just like, I should fancy, and very horrid. I began to wonder what on earth I should do, when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you think the play was, Harry?"

"I should think 'The Idiot Boy, or Dumb but Innocent.' Our fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, les grand pères ont toujours tort."

[26] "This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was 'Romeo and Juliet.' I must admit I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Jew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene was drawn up, and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most familiar terms with the pit. They were as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a pantomime of fifty years ago. But Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little flower-like face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me. And her voice,--I never heard such a voice. It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes, that seemed to fall singly upon one's ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant hautbois. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different. I don't know which to follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from her lover's lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap. She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and given him rue to wear, and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reed-like throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination. They are limited to their century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is no mystery in one of them. They ride in the Park in the morning, and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped smile, and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different an actress is! Why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?"

"Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian."

"Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces."

"Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary charm in them, sometimes."

[27] "I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane."

"You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life you will tell me everything you do."

"Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things. You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would come and confide it to you. You would understand me."

"People like you--the wilful sunbeams of life--don't commit crimes, Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now tell me,--reach me the matches, like a good boy: thanks,--tell me, what are your relations with Sibyl Vane?"

Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes. "Harry, Sibyl Vane is sacred!"

"It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian," said Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. "But why should you be annoyed? I suppose she will be yours some day. When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?"

"Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over, and offered to bring me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years, and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he thought I had taken too much champagne, or something."

"I am not surprised."

"I was not surprised either. Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him, and that they were all to be bought."

"I believe he was quite right there. But, on the other hand, most of them are not at all expensive."

"Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means. By this time the lights were being put out in the theatre, and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars which he strongly recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the theatre again. When he saw me he made me a low bow, and assured me that I was a patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with an air of pride, that his three bankruptcies were entirely due to the poet, whom he insisted on calling 'The Bard.' He seemed to think it a distinction."

"It was a distinction, my dear Dorian,--a great distinction. But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?"

"The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me; at least I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed determined to bring me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not wanting to know her, wasn't it?"

[28] "No; I don't think so."

"My dear Harry, why?"

"I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl."

"Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy, and so gentle. There is something of a child about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood grinning at the door-way of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like children. He would insist on calling me 'My Lord,' so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me, 'You look more like a prince.'"

"Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments."

"You don't understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and who looks as if she had seen better days."

"I know that look. It always depresses me."

"The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest me."

"You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about other people's tragedies."

"Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came from? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and entirely divine. I go to see her act every night of my life, and every night she is more marvellous."

"That is the reason, I suppose, that you will never dine with me now. I thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is not quite what I expected."

"My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have been to the Opera with you several times."

"You always come dreadfully late."

"Well, I can't help going to see Sibyl play, even if it is only for an act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am filled with awe."

"You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can't you?"

He shook his head. "To-night she is Imogen," he answered, "and tomorrow night she will be Juliet."

"When is she Sibyl Vane?"

"Never."

"I congratulate you."

"How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one. She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the [29] world to hear our laughter, and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry, how I worship her!" He was walking up and down the room as he spoke. Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited.

Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different he was now from the shy, frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward's studio! His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his Soul, and Desire had come to meet it on the way.

"And what do you propose to do?" said Lord Henry, at last.

"I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I have not the slightest fear of the result. You won't be able to refuse to recognize her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew's hands. She is bound to him for three years--at least for two years and eight months--from the present time. I will have to pay him something, of course. When all that is settled, I will take a West-End theatre and bring her out properly. She will make the world as mad as she has made me."

"Impossible, my dear boy!"

"Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it is personalities, not principles, that move the age."

"Well, what night shall we go?"

"Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet to-morrow."

"All right. The Bristol at eight o'clock; and I will get Basil."

"Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets Romeo."

"Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea. However, just as you wish. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to him?"

"Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame, designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous of it for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him. I don't want to see him alone. He says things that annoy me."

Lord Henry smiled. "He gives you good advice, I suppose. People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves."

"You don't mean to say that Basil has got any passion or any romance in him?"

"I don't know whether he has any passion, but he certainly has romance," said Lord Henry, with an amused look in his eyes. "Has he never let you know that?"

"Never. I must ask him about it. I am rather surprised to hear it. He is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that."

"Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into [30] his work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists give everything to their art, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in themselves. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize."

"I wonder is that really so, Harry?" said Dorian Gray, putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large gold-topped bottle that stood on the table. "It must be, if you say so. And now I must be off. Imogen is waiting for me. Don't forget about to-morrow. Good-by."

As he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled by the methods of science, but the ordinary subject-matter of science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others. Human life,--that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating. There was nothing else of any value, compared to it. It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass, or keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional colored life of the intellect,--to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they became one, and at what point they were at discord,--there was a delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.

He was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his, musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent, the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its [31] way, a real work of art, Life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.

Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.

Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were! There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.

He began to wonder whether we should ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name we gave to our mistakes. Men had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain moral efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.

It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences; yet it was not a simple but rather a very complex passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to the boy himself to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.

While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the door, and his valet entered, and reminded him it was time to dress [32] for dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a faded rose. He thought of Dorian Gray's young fiery-colored life, and wondered how it was all going to end.

When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a telegram lying on the hall-table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.




CHAPTER IV

[...32] "I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?" said Lord Henry on the following evening, as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.

"No, Harry," answered Hallward, giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter. "What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope? They don't interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting; though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing."

"Dorian Gray is engaged to be married," said Lord Henry, watching him as he spoke.

Hallward turned perfectly pale, and a curious look flashed for a moment into his eyes, and then passed away, leaving them dull. "Dorian engaged to be married!" he cried. "Impossible!"

"It is perfectly true."

"To whom?"

"To some little actress or other."

"I can't believe it. Dorian is far too sensible."

"Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear Basil."

"Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry," said Hallward, smiling.

"Except in America. But I didn't say he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I never was engaged."

"But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth. It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him."

"If you want him to marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is sure to do it then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives."

"I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don't want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect."

"Oh, she is more than good--she is beautiful," murmured Lord Henry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. "Dorian says she is beautiful; and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. [33] Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, among others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn't forget his appointment."

"But do you approve of it, Harry?" asked Hallward, walking up and down the room, and biting his lip. "You can't approve of it, really. It is some silly infatuation."

"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a personality fascinates me, whatever the personality chooses to do is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Shakespeare, and proposes to marry her. Why not? If he wedded Messalina he would be none the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colorless. They lack individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly organized. Besides, every experience is of value, and, whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He would be a wonderful study."

"You don't mean all that, Harry; you know you don't. If Dorian Gray's life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be."

Lord Henry laughed. "The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbor with those virtues that are likely to benefit ourselves. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest contempt for optimism. And as for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I can."

"My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!" said the boy, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings, and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. "I have never been so happy. Of course it is sudden: all really delightful things are. And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life." He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome.

"I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian," said Hallward, "but I don't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement. You let Harry know."

"And I don't forgive you for being late for dinner," broke in Lord [34] Henry, putting his hand on the lad's shoulder, and smiling as he spoke. "Come, let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like, and then you will tell us how it all came about."

"There is really not much to tell," cried Dorian, as they took their seats at the small round table. "What happened was simply this. After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I had some dinner at that curious little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street, you introduced me to, and went down afterwards to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course the scenery was dreadful, and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy's dress she was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-colored velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim brown cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting--well, you will see her to-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance was over I went behind, and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly there came a look into her eyes that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each other. I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-colored joy. She trembled all over, and shook like a white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't help it. Of course our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own mother. I don't know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I don't care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven't I, to take my love out of poetry, and to find my wife in Shakespeare's plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth."

"Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right," said Hallward, slowly.

"Have you seen her to-day?" asked Lord Henry.

Dorian Gray shook his head. "I left her in the forest of Arden, I shall find her in an orchard in Verona."

Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. "At what particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? and what did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it."

"My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared to her."

"Women are wonderfully practical," murmured Lord Henry,--"much more practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage, and they always remind us."

[35] Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. "Don't, Harry. You have annoyed Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any one. His nature is too fine for that."

Lord Henry looked across the table. "Dorian is never annoyed with me," he answered. "I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any question,--simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women, except, of course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not modern."

Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. "You are quite incorrigible, Harry; but I don't mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When you see Sibyl Vane you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any one can wish to shame what he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I wish to place her on a pedestal of gold, and to see the world worship the woman who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. And it is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her, I regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful theories."

"You will always like me, Dorian," said Lord Henry. "Will you have some coffee, you fellows?--Waiter, bring coffee, and fine-champagne, and some cigarettes. No: don't mind the cigarettes; I have some.--Basil, I can't allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can you want?--Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit."

"What nonsense you talk, Harry!" cried Dorian Gray, lighting his cigarette from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table. "Let us go down to the theatre. When you see Sibyl you will have a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you have never known."

"I have known everything," said Lord Henry, with a sad look in his eyes, "but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid that there is no such thing, for me at any rate. Still, your wonderful girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life. Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me.--I am so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a hansom."

They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. Hallward was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that might have happened. After a few moments, they all passed down-stairs. He drove off by himself, as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. [36] He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past. His eyes darkened, and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to him. When the cab drew up at the doors of the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.




CHAPTER V

[...36] For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily, tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands, and talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand, and assured him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over Shakespeare. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of fire. The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each other across the theatre, and shared their oranges with the tawdry painted girls who sat by them. Some women were laughing in the pit; their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.

"What a place to find one's divinity in!" said Lord Henry.

"Yes!" answered Dorian Gray. "It was here I found her, and she is divine beyond all living things. When she acts you will forget everything. These common people here, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self."

"Oh, I hope not!" murmured Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass.

"Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian," said Hallward. "I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love must be marvellous, and any girl that has the effect you describe must be fine and noble. To spiritualize one's age,--that is something worth doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. God made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been incomplete."

"Thanks, Basil," answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. "I [37] knew that you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is good in me."

A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly lovely to look at,--one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded, enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces, and her lips seemed to tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud. Dorian Gray sat motionless, gazing on her, like a man in a dream. Lord Henry peered through his opera-glass, murmuring, "Charming! charming!"

The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his pilgrim's dress had entered with Mercutio and his friends. The band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily-dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, as she danced, as a plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were like the curves of a white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.

Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on Romeo. The few lines she had to speak,--

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss,--
with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in color. It took away all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.

Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.

Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was nothing in her.

She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She over-emphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage,--

Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night,--
[38] was declaimed with the painful precision of a school-girl who has been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines,--

                        Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say, "It lightens." Sweet, good-night!
This bud of love by summer's ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet,--
she spoke the words as if they conveyed no meaning to her. It was not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she seemed absolutely self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.

Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was the girl herself.

When the second act was over there came a storm of hisses, and Lord Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. "She is quite beautiful, Dorian," he said, "but she can't act. Let us go."

"I am going to see the play through," answered the lad, in a hard, bitter voice. "I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening, Harry. I apologize to both of you."

"My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill," interrupted Hallward. "We will come some other night."

"I wish she was ill," he rejoined. "But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great artist. To-night she is merely a commonplace, mediocre actress."

"Don't talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more wonderful thing than art."

"They are both simply forms of imitation," murmured Lord Henry. "But do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don't suppose you will want your wife to act. So what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience. There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating,--people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?"

"Please go away, Harry," cried the lad. "I really want to be alone.--Basil, you don't mind my asking you to go? Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking?" The hot tears came to his eyes. His [39] lips trembled, and, rushing to the back of the box, he leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.

"Let us go, Basil," said Lord Henry, with a strange tenderness in his voice; and the two young men passed out together.

A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up, and the curtain rose on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale, and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots, and laughing. The whole thing was a fiasco. The last act was played to almost empty benches.

As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom. The girl was standing alone there, with a look of triumph on her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own.

When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy came over her. "How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!" she cried.

"Horribly!" he answered, gazing at her in amazement,--"horribly! It was dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea what I suffered."

The girl smiled. "Dorian," she answered, lingering over his name with long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her lips,--"Dorian, you should have understood. But you understand now, don't you?"

"Understand what?" he asked, angrily.

"Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall never act well again."

He shrugged his shoulders. "You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill you shouldn't act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored. I was bored."

She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An ecstasy of happiness dominated her.

"Dorian, Dorian," she cried, "before I knew you, acting was the one reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night, and Portia the other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came,--oh, my beautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness, of the empty pageant in which I had always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, not what I wanted to say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection. You have made me understand what love really is. My love! my love! I am sick [40] of shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What should they know of love? Take me away, Dorian--take me away with you, where we can be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it all means? Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me see that."

He flung himself down on the sofa, and turned away his face. "You have killed my love," he muttered.

She looked at him in wonder, and laughed. He made no answer. She came across to him, and stroked his hair with her little fingers. She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a shudder ran through him.

Then he leaped up, and went to the door. "Yes," he cried, "you have killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't even stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because you were wonderful, because you had genius and intellect, because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think of you. I will never mention your name. You don't know what you were to me, once. Why, once . . . . Oh, I can't bear to think of it! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! What are you without your art? Nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have belonged to me. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty face."

The girl grew white, and trembled. She clinched her hands together, and her voice seemed to catch in her throat. "You are not serious, Dorian?" she murmured. "You are acting."

"Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well," he answered, bitterly.

She rose from her knees, and, with a piteous expression of pain in her face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm, and looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. "Don't touch me!" he cried.

A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet, and lay there like a trampled flower. "Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!" she whispered. "I am so sorry I didn't act well. I was thinking of you all the time. But I will try,--indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me,--if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love. Don't go away from me. I couldn't bear it. Can't you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard, and try to [41] improve. Don't be cruel to me because I love you better than anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me; and yet I couldn't help it. Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me." A fit of passionate sobbing choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous about the passions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed him.

"I am going," he said at last, in his calm, clear voice. "I don't wish to be unkind, but I can't see you again. You have disappointed me."

She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer to him. Her little hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He turned on his heel, and left the room. In a few moments he was out of the theatre.

Where he went to, he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly-lit streets with gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him. Drunkards had reeled by cursing, and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps, and had heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.

When the dawn was just breaking he found himself at Covent Garden. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market, and watched the men unloading their wagons. A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its gray sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over. After some time he hailed a hansom and drove home. The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it. As he was passing through the library towards the door of his bedroom, his eye fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back in surprise, and then went over to it and examined it. In the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-colored silk blinds, the face seemed to him to be a little changed. The expression looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly curious.

He turned round, and, walking to the window, drew the blinds up. The bright dawn flooded the room, and swept the fantastic shadows [42] into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even. The quivering, ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.

He winced, and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids, that Lord Henry had given him, he glanced hurriedly into it. No line like that warped his red lips. What did it mean?

He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly apparent.

He threw himself into a chair, and began to think. Suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his prayer had not been answered? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the mouth.

Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl's fault, not his. He had dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane? She was nothing to him now.

But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty. Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it again?

No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that [43] makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.

Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would alter more. Its gold would wither into gray. Its red and white roses would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more,--would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be beautiful and pure.

He got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. "How horrible!" he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of Sibyl Vane. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.




CHAPTER VI

[...43] It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times into the room on tiptoe to see if he was stirring, and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a small tray of old Sèvres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall windows.

"Monsieur has well slept this morning," he said, smiling.

"What o'clock is it, Victor?" asked Dorian Gray, sleepily.

"One hour and a quarter, monsieur."

How late it was! He sat up, and, having sipped some tea, turned over his letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like, that are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season. There was a [44] rather heavy bill, for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set, that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when only unnecessary things are absolutely necessary to us; and there were several very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.

After about ten minutes he got up, and, throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown, passed into the onyx-paved bath-room. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep. He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.

As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a light French breakfast, that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to an open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in, and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, that stood in front of him. He felt perfectly happy.

Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait, and he started.

"Too cold for Monsieur?" asked his valet, putting an omelette on the table. "I shut the window?"

Dorian shook his head. "I am not cold," he murmured.

Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It would make him smile.

And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of cruelty in the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a mad desire to tell him to remain. As the door closed behind him he called him back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a moment. "I am not at home to any one, Victor," he said, with a sigh. The man bowed and retired.

He rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a luxuriously-cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen was an old one of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously, wondering if it had ever before concealed the secret of a man's life.

Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, other eyes than his spied behind, and saw the horrible change? What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own picture? He would be sure to do that. No; the [45] thing had to be examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt.

He got up, and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside, and saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had altered.

As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms, that shaped themselves into form and color on the canvas, and the soul that was within him? Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.

One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would be to him what holiness was to some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls.

Three o'clock struck, and four, and half-past four, but he did not stir. He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life, and to weave them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness, and accusing himself of madness. He covered page after page with wild words of sorrow, and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian Gray had finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.

Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry's voice outside. "My dear Dorian, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can't bear your shutting yourself up like this."

He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking still continued, and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.

"I am so sorry for it all, my dear boy," said Lord Henry, coming in. "But you must not think about it too much."

[46] "Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?" asked Dorian.

"Yes, of course," answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair, and slowly pulling his gloves off. "It is dreadful, from one point of view, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her after the play was over?"

"Yes."

"I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?"

"I was brutal, Harry,--perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better."

"Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse, and tearing your nice hair."

"I have got through all that," said Dorian, shaking his head, and smiling. "I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more,--at least not before me. I want to be good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being hideous."

"A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you on it. But how are you going to begin?"

"By marrying Sibyl Vane."

"Marrying Sibyl Vane!" cried Lord Henry, standing up, and looking at him in perplexed amazement. "But, my dear Dorian--"

"Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about marriage. Don't say it. Don't ever say things of that kind to me again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife."

"Your wife! Dorian! . . . Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this morning, and sent the note down, by my own man."

"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like."

Lord Henry walked across the room, and, sitting down by Dorian Gray, took both his hands in his, and held them tightly. "Dorian," he said, "my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead."

A cry of pain rose from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp. "Dead! Sibyl dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie!"

"It is quite true, Dorian," said Lord Henry, gravely. "It is in all the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris. But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make one's début with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to one's old age. I don't suppose they know your name at the theatre. If they don't, it is all right. Did any one see you going round to her room? That is an important point."

Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror. Finally he murmured, in a stifled voice, "Harry, did you say an inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl--? Oh, [47] Harry, I can't bear it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once."

"I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put in that way to the public. As she was leaving the theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten something up-stairs. They waited some time for her, but she did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don't know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously. It is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it. I see by the Standard that she was seventeen. I should have thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn't let this thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at the Opera. It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there. You can come to my sister's box. She has got some smart women with her."

"So I have murdered Sibyl Vane," said Dorian Gray, half to himself,--"murdered her as certainly as if I had cut her little throat with a knife. And the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go on to the Opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears. Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh, Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was everything to me. Then came that dreadful night--was it really only last night?--when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a bit. I thought her shallow. Then something happened that made me afraid. I can't tell you what it was, but it was awful. I said I would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My God! my God! Harry, what shall I do? You don't know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her."

"My dear Dorian, the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life. If you had married this girl you would have been wretched. Of course you would have treated her kindly. One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's husband has to [48] pay for. I say nothing about the social mistake, but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure."

"I suppose it would," muttered the lad, walking up and down the room, and looking horribly pale. "But I thought it was my duty. It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right. I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions,--that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were."

"Good resolutions are simply a useless attempt to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil. They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for us. That is all that can be said for them."

"Harry," cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him, "why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I don't think I am heartless. Do you?"

"You have done too many foolish things in your life to be entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian," answered Lord Henry, with his sweet, melancholy smile.

The lad frowned. "I don't like that explanation, Harry," he rejoined, "but I am glad you don't think I am heartless. I am nothing of the kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible beauty of a great tragedy, a tragedy in which I took part, but by which I have not been wounded."

"It is an interesting question," said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism,--"an extremely interesting question. I fancy that the explanation is this. It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that has artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.

[49] "Of course, now and then things linger. I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity. Well,--would you believe it?--a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance in a bed of poppies. She dragged it out again, and assured me that I had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it. If they were allowed to have their way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you. Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colors. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one's face, as if it was the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me; and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. There is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one of all."

"What is that, Harry?" said Dorian Gray, listlessly.

"Oh, the obvious one. Taking some one else's admirer when one loses one's own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen. They make one believe in the reality of the things that shallow, fashionable people play with, such as romance, passion, and love."

"I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that."

"I believe that women appreciate cruelty more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I have never seen you angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it explains everything."

[50] "What was that, Harry?"

"You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of romance--that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen."

"She will never come to life again now," murmured the lad, burying his face in his hands.

"No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived, and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare's plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare's music sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died. But don't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real than they are."

There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colors faded wearily out of things.

After some time Dorian Gray looked up. "You have explained me to myself, Harry," he murmured, with something of a sigh of relief. "I felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all. I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous."

"Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do."

"But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and gray, and wrinkled? What then?"

"Ah, then," said Lord Henry, rising to go,--"then, my dear Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you. And now you had better dress, and drive down to the club. We are rather late, as it is."

"I think I shall join you at the Opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat anything. What is the number of your sister's box?"

"Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her name on the door. But I am sorry you won't come and dine."

"I don't feel up to it," said Dorian, wearily. "But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have."

"We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian," answered Lord Henry, shaking him by the hand. "Good-by. I shall see you before nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing."

As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, [51] and in a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down. He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an interminable time about everything.

As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen, and drew it back. No; there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul? he wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.

Poor Sibyl! what a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked death on the stage, and at last Death himself had touched her, and brought her with him. How had she played that dreadful scene? Had she cursed him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything, by the sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what she had made him go through, that horrible night at the theatre. When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure to show Love had been a great reality. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her child-like look and winsome fanciful ways and shy tremulous grace. He wiped them away hastily, and looked again at the picture.

He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him,--life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins,--he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.

A feeling of pain came over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded? Was it to become a hideous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of the hair? The pity of it! the pity of it!

For a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged. And, yet, who, that knew anything about Life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught? Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its [52] influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom, in secret love or strange affinity? But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?

For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer. When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the colored image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.

He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture, smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the Opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his chair.




CHAPTER VII

[...52] As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room.

"I am so glad I have found you, Dorian," he said, gravely. "I called last night, and they told me you were at the Opera. Of course I knew that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of the Globe, that I picked up at the club. I came here at once, and was miserable at not finding you. I can't tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer. But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl's mother? For a moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about it all?"

"My dear Basil, how do I know?" murmured Dorian, sipping some pale-yellow wine from a delicate gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass, and looking dreadfully bored. "I was at the Opera. You should have come on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first time. We were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely. Don't talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn't [53] talk about a thing, it has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things. Tell me about yourself and what you are painting."

"You went to the Opera?" said Hallward, speaking very slowly, and with a strained touch of pain in his voice. "You went to the Opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!"

"Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!" cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. "You must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is past."

"You call yesterday the past?"

"What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."

"Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who used to come down to my studio, day after day, to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry's influence. I see that."

The lad flushed up, and, going to the window, looked out on the green, flickering garden for a few moments. "I owe a great deal to Harry, Basil," he said, at last,--"more than I owe to you. You only taught me to be vain."

"Well, I am punished for that, Dorian,--or shall be some day."

"I don't know what you mean, Basil," he exclaimed, turning round. "I don't know what you want. What do you want?"

"I want the Dorian Gray I used to know."

"Basil," said the lad, going over to him, and putting his hand on his shoulder, "you have come too late. Yesterday when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself--"

"Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?" cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.

"My dear Basil! Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident? Of course she killed herself It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean,--middle-class virtue, and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of [54] martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment,--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six,--you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely, then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered,--I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlowe together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp,--there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not realized how I have developed. I was a school-boy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course I am very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not stronger,--you are too much afraid of life,--but you are better. And how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said."

Hallward felt strangely moved. Rugged and straightforward as he was, there was something in his nature that was purely feminine in its tenderness. The lad was infinitely dear to him, and his personality had been the great turning-point in his art. He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.

"Well, Dorian," he said, at length, with a sad smile, "I won't speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?"

Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word "inquest." There was something so [55] crude and vulgar about everything of the kind. "They don't know my name," he answered.

"But surely she did?"

"Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of her, Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words."

"I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you must come and sit to me yourself again. I can't get on without you."

"I will never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!" he exclaimed, starting back.

Hallward stared at him, "My dear boy, what nonsense!" he cried. "Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best thing I have ever painted. Do take that screen away, Dorian. It is simply horrid of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room looked different as I came in."

"My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don't imagine I let him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes,--that is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait."

"Too strong! Impossible, my dear fellow! It is an admirable place for it. Let me see it." And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.

A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between Hallward and the screen. "Basil," he said, looking very pale, "you must not look at it. I don't wish you to."

"Not look at my own work! you are not serious. Why shouldn't I look at it?" exclaimed Hallward, laughing.

"If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honor I will never speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don't offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us."

Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was absolutely pallid with rage. His hands were clinched, and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.

"Dorian!"

"Don't speak!"

"But what is the matter? Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to," he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel, and going over towards the window. "But, really, it seems rather absurd that I shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?"

"To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?" exclaimed Dorian Gray, a strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going [56] to be shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That was impossible. Something--he did not know what--had to be done at once.

"Yes: I don't suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Sèze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you hide it always behind a screen, you can't care much about it."

Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger. "You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it," he said. "Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others. The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can't have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the same thing." He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half seriously and half in jest, "If you want to have an interesting quarter of an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won't exhibit your picture. He told me why he wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me." Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.

"Basil," he said, coming over quite close, and looking him straight in the face, "we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I will tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?"

Hallward shuddered in spite of himself. "Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation."

"No, Basil, you must tell me," murmured Dorian Gray. "I think I have a right to know." His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward's mystery.

"Let us sit down, Dorian," said Hallward, looking pale and pained. "Let us sit down. I will sit in the shadow, and you shall sit in the sunlight. Our lives are like that. Just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the picture something that you did not like?--something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?"

"Basil!" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands, and gazing at him with wild, startled eyes.

"I see you did. Don't speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say. It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance of feeling than a man usually gives to a friend. Somehow, I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. Perhaps, as [57] Harry says, a really 'grande passion' is the privilege of those who have nothing to do, and that is the use of the idle classes in a country. Well, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I quite admit that I adored you madly, extravagantly, absurdly. I was jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When I was away from you, you were still present in my art. It was all wrong and foolish. It is all wrong and foolish still. Of course I never let you know anything about this. It would have been impossible. You would not have understood it; I did not understand it myself. One day I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you. It was to have been my masterpiece. It is my masterpiece. But, as I worked at it, every flake and film of color seemed to me to reveal my secret. I grew afraid that the world would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much. Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right. Well, after a few days the portrait left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had said anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is more abstract than we fancy. Form and color tell us of form and color,--that is all. It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were right. The picture must not be shown. You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped."

Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The color came back to his cheeks, and a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the young man who had just made this strange confession to him. He wondered if he would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord Harry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of the things that life had in store?

"It is extraordinary to me, Dorian," said Hallward, "that you should have seen this in the picture. Did you really see it?"

"Of course I did."

"Well, you don't mind my looking at it now?"

Dorian shook his head. "You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture."

"You will some day, surely?"

[58] "Never."

"Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-by, Dorian. You have been the one person in my life of whom I have been really fond. I don't suppose I shall often see you again. You don't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you."

"My dear Basil," cried Dorian, "what have you told me? Simply that you felt that you liked me too much. That is not even a compliment."

"It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession."

"A very disappointing one."

"Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn't see anything else in the picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?"

"No: there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn't talk about not meeting me again, or anything of that kind. You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so."

"You have got Harry," said Hallward, sadly.

"Oh, Harry!" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. "Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible, and his evenings in doing what is improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I don't think I would go to Harry if I was in trouble. I would sooner go to you, Basil."

"But you won't sit to me again?"

"Impossible!"

"You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes across two ideal things. Few come across one."

"I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again. I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant."

"Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured Hallward, regretfully. "And now good-by. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once again. But that can't be helped. I quite understand what you feel about it."

As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! how little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that strange confession explained to him! Basil's absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious reticences,--he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There was something tragic in a friendship so colored by romance.

He sighed, and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad of him to have the thing remain, even for an hour, in a room to which any of his friends had access.




CHAPTER VIII

[...58] When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite impassive, and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette, [59] and walked over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of Victor's face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his guard.

Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the housekeeper that he wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker's and ask him to send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man left the room he peered in the direction of the screen. Or was that only his fancy?

After a few moments, Mrs. Leaf, a dear old lady in a black silk dress, with a photograph of the late Mr. Leaf framed in a large gold brooch at her neck, and old-fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled hands, bustled into the room.

"Well, Master Dorian," she said, "what can I do for you? I beg your pardon, sir,"--here came a courtesy,--"I shouldn't call you Master Dorian any more. But, Lord bless you, sir, I have known you since you were a baby, and many's the trick you've played on poor old Leaf. Not that you were not always a good boy, sir; but boys will be boys, Master Dorian, and jam is a temptation to the young, isn't it, sir?"

He laughed. "You must always call me Master Dorian, Leaf. I will be very angry with you if you don't. And I assure you I am quite as fond of jam now as I used to be. Only when I am asked out to tea I am never offered any. I want you to give me the key of the room at the top of the house."

"The old school-room, Master Dorian? Why, it's full of dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It's not fit for you to see, Master Dorian. It is not, indeed."

"I don't want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key."

"Well, Master Dorian, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you goes into it. Why, it hasn't been opened for nearly five years,--not since his lordship died."

He winced at the mention of his dead uncle's name. He had hateful memories of him. "That does not matter, Leaf," he replied. "All I want is the key."

"And here is the key, Master Dorian," said the old lady, after going over the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. "Here is the key. I'll have it off the ring in a moment. But you don't think of living up there, Master Dorian, and you so comfortable here?"

"No, Leaf, I don't. I merely want to see the place, and perhaps store something in it,--that is all. Thank you, Leaf. I hope your rheumatism is better; and mind you send me up jam for breakfast."

Mrs. Leaf shook her head. "Them foreigners doesn't understand jam, Master Dorian. They calls it 'compot.' But I'll bring it to you myself some morning, if you lets me."

"That will be very kind of you, Leaf," he answered, looking at the key; and, having made him an elaborate courtesy, the old lady left the room, her face wreathed in smiles. She had a strong objection to the French valet. It was a poor thing, she felt, for any one to be born a foreigner.

[60] As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket, and looked round the room. His eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work that his uncle had found in a convent near Bologna. Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death itself,--something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive.

He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that he bore him--for it was really love--had something noble and intellectual in it. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses, and that dies when the senses tire. It was such love as Michael Angelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real.

He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was unchanged; and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips,--they all were there. It was simply the expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil's reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!--how shallow, and of what little account! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and calling him to judgment. A look of pain came across him, and he flung the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door. He passed out as his servant entered.

"The persons are here, monsieur."

He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the writing-table, he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him round something to read, and reminding him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.

"Wait for an answer," he said, handing it to him, "and show the men in here."

In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Ashton himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Ashton was a florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was considerably [61] tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in favor of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?" he said, rubbing his fat freckled hands. "I thought I would do myself the honor of coming round in person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited for a religious picture, Mr. Gray."

"I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr. Ashton. I will certainly drop in and look at the frame,--though I don't go in much for religious art,--but to-day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men."

"No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to you. Which is the work of art, sir?"

"This," replied Dorian, moving the screen back. "Can you move it, covering and all, just as it is? I don't want it to get scratched going up-stairs."

"There will be no difficulty, sir," said the genial frame-maker, beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended. "And, now, where shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?"

"I will show you the way, Mr. Ashton, if you will kindly follow me. Or perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider."

He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious protests of Mr. Ashton, who had a true tradesman's dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it so as to help them.

"Something of a load to carry, sir," gasped the little man, when they reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.

"A terrible load to carry," murmured Dorian, as he unlocked the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.

He had not entered the place for more than four years,--not, indeed, since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child and then as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord Sherard for the use of the little nephew whom, being himself childless, and perhaps for other reasons, he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance. It did not appear to Dorian to have much changed. There was the huge Italian cassone, with its fantastically-painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy. There was the satinwood bookcase filled with his dog-eared school-books. On the wall behind it was hanging the same [62] ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he recalled it all! Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him, as he looked round. He remembered the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was here that the fatal portrait was to be hidden away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store for him!

But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He kept his youth,--that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh,--those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.

No; that was impossible. The thing upon the canvas was growing old, hour by hour, and week by week. Even if it escaped the hideousness of sin, the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow's-feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the uncle who had been so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed. There was no help for it.

"Bring it in, Mr. Ashton, please," he said, wearily, turning round. "I am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else."

"Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray," answered the frame-maker, who was still gasping for breath. "Where shall we put it, sir?"

"Oh, anywhere, Here, this will do. I don't want to have it hung up. Just lean it against the wall. Thanks."

"Might one look at the work of art, sir?"

Dorian started. "It would not interest you, Mr. Ashton," he said, keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life. "I won't trouble you any more now. I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round."

"Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you, sir." And Mr. Ashton tramped down-stairs, followed by the assistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough, uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.

When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked [63] the door, and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look on the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.

On reaching the library he found that it was just after five o'clock, and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from his guardian's wife, Lady Radley, who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of the St. James's Gazette had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing. He would be sure to miss the picture,--had no doubt missed it already, while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been replaced, and the blank space on the wall was visible. Perhaps some night he might find him creeping up-stairs and trying to force the door of the room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house. He had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a bit of crumpled lace.

He sighed, and, having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry's note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at eight-fifteen. He opened the St. James's languidly, and looked through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. He read the following paragraph:

"INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.--An inquest was held this morning at the Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre, Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased."

He frowned slightly, and, tearing the paper in two, went across the room and flung the pieces into a gilt basket. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for having sent him the account. And it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more than enough English for that.

Perhaps he had read it, and had begun to suspect something. And, yet, what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's death? There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.

His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was it, he wondered. He went towards the little pearl-colored octagonal stand, that had always looked to him like the work of some [64] strange Egyptian bees who wrought in silver, and took the volume up. He flung himself into an arm-chair, and began to turn over the leaves. After a few minutes, he became absorbed. It was the strangest book he had ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed.

It was a novel without a plot, and with only one character, being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian, who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of argot and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French school of Décadents. There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids, and as evil in color. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odor of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of revery, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and the creeping shadows.

Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and, going into the next room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his bedside, and began to dress for dinner.

It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where he found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very bored.

"I am so sorry, Harry," he cried, "but really it is entirely your fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot what the time was."

"I thought you would like it," replied his host, rising from his chair.

"I didn't say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference."

"Ah, if you have discovered that, you have discovered a great deal," murmured Lord Henry, with his curious smile. "Come, let us go in to dinner. It is dreadfully late, and I am afraid the champagne will be too much iced."




CHAPTER IX

[65] For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the memory of this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than five large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colors, so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian, in whom the romantic temperament and the scientific temperament were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And, indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life, written before he had lived it.

In one point he was more fortunate than the book's fantastic hero. He never knew--never, indeed, had any cause to know--that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water, which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beauty that had once, apparently, been so remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy--and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place--that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat over-emphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and in the world, he had most valued.

He, at any rate, had no cause to fear that. The boyish beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had heard the most evil things against him (and from time to time strange rumors about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs) could not believe anything to his dishonor when they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensuous.

He himself, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, would creep up-stairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and often with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, [66] wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.

There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicately-scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the Docks, which, under an assumed name, and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul, with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare. That curiosity about life that, many years before, Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.

Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to belong to those whom Dante describes as having sought to "make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty." Like Gautier, he was one for whom "the visible world existed."

And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation. Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and Dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that he affected from time to time, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.

For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the "Satyricon" had once been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or [67] the conduct of a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.

The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than ourselves, and that we are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through History, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear, and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape, Nature in her wonderful irony driving the anchorite out to herd with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.

Yes, there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new hedonism that was to re-create life, and to save it from that harsh, uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly; yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.

There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make one almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of revery. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. Black fantastic shadows crawl into the corners of the room, and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills, and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colors of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we have left them, and beside them [68] lies the half-read book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been re-fashioned anew for our pleasure in the darkness, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colors, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the memories of pleasure their pain.

It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or among the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their color and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardor of temperament, and that indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.

It was rumored of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion; and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement, and with the priest, in his stiff flowered cope, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, and raising aloft the jewelled lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the "panis caelestis," the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice, and smiting his breast for his sins. The fuming censers, that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers, had their subtle fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals, and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the tarnished grating the true story of their lives.

But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a [69] season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their mysteries to reveal.

And so he would now study perfumes, and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily-scented oils, and burning odorous gums from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots, and scented pollen-laden flowers, of aromatic balms, and of dark and fragrant woods, of spikenard that sickens, of hovenia that makes men mad, and of aloes that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.

At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad gypsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while grinning negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums, or turbaned Indians, crouching upon scarlet mats, blew through long pipes of reed or brass, and charmed, or feigned to charm, great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look at, and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chili, and the sonorous green stones that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long clarin of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh turé of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in trees, and that can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the teponaztli, that [70] has two vibrating tongues of wood, and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the yotl-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that Art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the Opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to "Tannhäuser," and seeing in that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.

On another occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls. He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wire-like line of silver, the pistachio-colored peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of color, and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.

He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso's "Clericalis Disciplina" a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander he was said to have found snakes in the vale of Jordan "with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs." There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and "by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe" the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep, and slain. According to the great alchemist Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her color. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids. Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly-killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any danger by fire.

The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand, as the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the Priest were "made of sardius, with the horn of the horned [71] snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within." Over the gable were "two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles," so that the gold might shine by day, and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge's strange romance "A Margarite of America" it was stated that in the chamber of Margarite were seen "all the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults." Marco Polo had watched the inhabitants of Zipangu place a rose-colored pearl in the mouth of the dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over his loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit, he flung it away,--Procopius tells the story,--nor was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown a Venetian a rosary of one hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he worshipped.

When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII. of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantôme, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with three hundred and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II. had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as wearing "a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large balasses." The favorites of James I. wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane. Edward II. gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armor studded with jacinths, and a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap parsemé with pearls. Henry II. wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove set with twelve rubies and fifty-two great pearls. The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was studded with sapphires and hung with pear-shaped pearls.

How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.

Then he turned his attention to embroideries, and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescos in the chill rooms of the Northern nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject,--and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up,--he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained his flower-like bloom. How different it was with material things! Where had they gone to? Where was the great crocus-colored robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked for Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, on which were represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by [72] white gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for Elagabalus, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, and were figured with "lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters,--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature;" and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "Madame, je suis tout joyeux," the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, a square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy, and was decorated with "thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold." Catherine de Médicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold-embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed had stood under it.

And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought, with gold-threat palmates, and stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the East as "woven air," and "running water," and "evening dew;" strange figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with fleurs de lys, birds, and images; veils of lacis worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades, and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work with its gilt coins, and Japanese Foukousas with their green-toned golds and their marvellously-plumaged birds.

He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for, and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He had a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine- [73] apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in colored silks upon the hood. This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and colored crystals. The morse bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He had chasubles, also, of amber-colored silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs de lys; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices to which these things were put there was something that quickened his imagination.

For these things, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life, and had draped the purple-and-gold pall in front of it as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate pleasure in mere existence. Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of rebellion that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling, with secret pleasure, at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.

After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where he had more than once spent his winter. He hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life, and he was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the elaborate bolts and bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.

He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked? Even if he told them, would they believe it?

Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great [74] house in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendor of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already suspected it.

For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him. He was blackballed at a West End club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the Carlton, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It was said that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as if they were determined to discover his secret.

Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies (for so they called them) that were circulated about him. It was remarked, however, that those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Of all his friends, or so-called friends, Lord Henry Wotton was the only one who remained loyal to him. Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.

Yet these whispered scandals only lent him, in the eyes of many, his strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of security. Society, civilized society at least, is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and charming. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and the highest respectability is of less value in its opinion than the possession of a good chef. And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for cold entrées, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject; and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays charming. Is insincerity such a [75] terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.

Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion. He used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the Ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery of his country-house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his "Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James," as one who was "caressed by the court for his handsome face, which kept him not long company." Was it young Herbert's life that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to that mad prayer that had so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wrist-bands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black armor piled at his feet. What had this man's legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of her temperament in him? Those oval heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain. Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord Sherard, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose! What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred within him. How curious it all seemed!

Yet one had ancestors in literature, as well as in one's own race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There [76] were times when it seemed to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of wonder. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.

The hero of the dangerous novel that had so influenced his life had himself had this curious fancy. In a chapter of the book he tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables, and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that taedium vitae, that comes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the Circus, and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold, and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with colors, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage, and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.

Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the chapter immediately following, in which the hero describes the curious tapestries that he had had woven for him from Gustave Moreau's designs, and on which were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom Vice and Blood and Weariness had made monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife, and painted her lips with a scarlet poison; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men, and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him, and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve her at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine,--the son of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent, and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a [77] Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta, and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honor of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI., who had so wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of Love and Death and Madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthus-like curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.

There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning,--poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.




CHAPTER X

[...77] It was on the 7th of November, the eve of his own thirty-second birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.

He was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's, where he had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street a man passed him in the mist, walking very fast, and with the collar of his gray ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. He recognized him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could not account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition, and went on slowly, in the direction of his own house.

But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping, and then hurrying after him. In a few moments his hand was on his arm.

"Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for you ever since nine o'clock in your library. Finally I took pity on your tired servant, and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I wanted particularly to see you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you passed me. But I wasn't quite sure. Didn't you recognize me?"

"In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don't feel at all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?"

"No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend [78] to take a studio in Paris, and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head. However, it wasn't about myself I wanted to talk. Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something to say to you."

"I shall be charmed. But won't you miss your train?" said Dorian Gray, languidly, as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his latch-key.

The lamp-light struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his watch. "I have heaps of time," he answered. "The train doesn't go till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan't have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes."

Dorian looked at him and smiled. "What a way for a fashionable painter to travel! A Gladstone bag, and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get into the house. And mind you don't talk about anything serious. Nothing is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be."

Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth. The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little table.

"You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me everything I wanted, including your best cigarettes. He is a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?"

Dorian shrugged his shoulders. "I believe he married Lady Ashton's maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker. Anglomanie is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly of the French, doesn't it? But--do you know?--he was not at all a bad servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted to me, and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room."

"Thanks, I won't have anything more," said Hallward, taking his cap and coat off, and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the corner. "And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously. Don't frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me."

"What is it all about?" cried Dorian, in his petulant way, flinging himself down on the sofa. "I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else."

"It is about yourself," answered Hallward, in his grave, deep voice, "and I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour."

Dorian sighed, and lit a cigarette. "Half an hour!" he murmured.

[79] "It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being said about you in London,--things that I could hardly repeat to you."

"I don't wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me. They have not got the charm of novelty."

"They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his good name. You don't want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded. Of course you have your position, and your wealth, and all that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind you, I don't believe these rumors at all. At least, I can't believe them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's face. It cannot be concealed. People talk of secret vices. There are no such things as secret vices. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even. Somebody--I won't mention his name, but you know him--came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though I have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I refused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him. His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth,--I can't believe anything against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don't know what to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house nor invite you to theirs? You used to be a friend of Lord Cawdor. I met him at dinner last week. Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Cawdor curled his lip, and said that you might have the most artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant. He told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why is your friendship so fateful to young men? There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England, with a tarnished name. You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton, and his dreadful end? What about Lord Kent's only son, and his career? I met his father yesterday in St. James Street. He seemed broken with shame and sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he got now? What gentleman would associate with him? Dorian, Dorian, your reputation is infamous. I know you and Harry are great friends. I say nothing about that now, but [80] surely you need not have made his sister's name a by-word. When you met Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the Park? Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are other stories,--stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your country-house, and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don't know what is said about you. I won't tell you that I don't want to preach to you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always said that, and then broke his word. I do want to preach to you. I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with. Don't shrug your shoulders like that. Don't be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one whom you become intimate with, and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house, for shame of some kind to follow after you. I don't know whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone. Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I told him that it was absurd,--that I knew you thoroughly, and that you were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul."

"To see my soul!" muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and turning almost white from fear.

"Yes," answered Hallward, gravely, and with infinite sorrow in his voice,--"to see your soul. But only God can do that."

A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. "You shall see it yourself, to-night!" he cried, seizing a lamp from the table. "Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn't you look at it? You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you. If they did believe you, they'd like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face."

There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous memory of what he had done.

"Yes," he continued, coming closer to him, and looking steadfastly into his stern eyes, "I will show you my soul. You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see."

[81] Hallward started back. "This is blasphemy, Dorian!" he cried. "You must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don't mean anything."

"You think so?" He laughed again.

"I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your good. You know I have been always devoted to you."

"Don't touch me. Finish what you have to say."

A twisted flash of pain shot across Hallward's face. He paused for a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of what was rumored about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he straightened himself up, and walked over to the fireplace, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frost-like ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.

"I am waiting, Basil," said the young man, in a hard, clear voice.

He turned round. "What I have to say is this," he cried. "You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I will believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can't you see what I am going through? My God! don't tell me that you are infamous!"

Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. "Come up-stairs, Basil," he said, quietly. "I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I will show it to you if you come with me."

"I will come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don't ask me to read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question."

"That will be given to you up-stairs. I could not give it here. You won't have to read long. Don't keep me waiting."




CHAPTER XI

[...81] He passed out of the room, and began the ascent, Basil Hallward following close behind. They walked softly, as men instinctively do at night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.

When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the floor, and taking out the key turned it in the lock. "You insist on knowing, Basil?" he asked, in a low voice.

"Yes."

"I am delighted," he murmured, smiling. Then he added, somewhat bitterly, "You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you think." And, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange. He shuddered. "Shut the door behind you," he said, as he placed the lamp on the table.

[82] Hallward glanced round him, with a puzzled expression. The room looked as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone, and an almost empty bookcase,--that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was standing on the mantel-shelf, he saw that the whole place was covered with dust, and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odor of mildew.

"So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that curtain back, and you will see mine."

The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. "You are mad, Dorian, or playing a part," muttered Hallward, frowning.

"You won't? Then I must do it myself," said the young man; and he tore the curtain from its rod, and flung it on the ground.

An exclamation of horror broke from Hallward's lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous thing on the canvas leering at him. There was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing. Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was looking at! The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely marred that marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual lips. The sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet passed entirely away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own brush-work, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.

It was some foul parody, some infamous, ignoble satire. He had never done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if his blood had changed from fire to sluggish ice in a moment. His own picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned, and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.

The young man was leaning against the mantel-shelf, watching him with that strange expression that is on the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when a great artist is acting. There was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in the eyes. He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.

"What does this mean?" cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded shrill and curious in his ears.

"Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, "you met me, devoted yourself to me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment, that [83] I don't know, even now, whether I regret or not, I made a wish. Perhaps you would call it a prayer . . . ."

"I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is impossible. The room is damp. The mildew has got into the canvas. The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the thing is impossible."

"Ah, what is impossible?" murmured the young man, going over to the window, and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.

"You told me you had destroyed it."

"I was wrong. It has destroyed me."

"I don't believe it is my picture."

"Can't you see your romance in it?" said Dorian, bitterly.

"My romance, as you call it . . ."

"As you called it."

"There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. This is the face of a satyr."

"It is the face of my soul."

"God! what a thing I must have worshipped! This has the eyes of a devil."

"Each of us has Heaven and Hell in him, Basil," cried Dorian, with a wild gesture of despair.

Hallward turned again to the portrait, and gazed at it. "My God! if it is true," he exclaimed, "and this is what you have done with your life, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be!" He held the light up again to the canvas, and examined it. The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed, and as he had left it. It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.

His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor, and lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his hands.

"Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! what an awful lesson!" There was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.

"Pray, Dorian, pray," he murmured. "What is it that one was taught to say in one's boyhood? 'Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash away our iniquities.' Let us say that together. The prayer of your pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped yourself too much. We are both punished."

Dorian Gray turned slowly around, and looked at him with tear-dimmed eyes. "It is too late, Basil," he murmured.

"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we can remember a prayer. Isn't there a verse somewhere, 'Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?"

[84] "Those words mean nothing to me now."

"Hush! don't say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God! don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?"

Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more than he had ever loathed anything in his whole life. He glanced wildly around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it, and turned round. Hallward moved in his chair as if he was going to rise. He rushed at him, and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on the table, and stabbing again and again.

There was a stifled groan, and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood. The outstretched arms shot up convulsively three times, waving grotesque stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him once more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he threw the knife on the table, and listened.

He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He opened the door, and went out on the landing. The house was quite quiet. No one was stirring.

He took out the key, and returned to the room, locking himself in as he did so.

The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck, and the clotted black pool that slowly widened on the table, one would have said that the man was simply asleep.

How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and, walking over to the window, opened it, and stepped out on the balcony. The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock's tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down, and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing a bull's-eye lantern on the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner, and then vanished. A woman in a ragged shawl was creeping round by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and then she stopped, and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the Square. The gas-lamps flickered, and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches as if in pain. He shivered, and went back, closing the window behind him.

He passed to the door, turned the key, and opened it. He did not even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted [85] the fatal portrait, the portrait to which all his misery had been due, had gone out of his life. That was enough.

Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished steel. Perhaps it might be missed by his servant, and questions would be asked. He turned back, and took it from the table. How still the man was! How horribly white the long hands looked! He was like a dreadful wax image.

He locked the door behind him, and crept quietly down-stairs. The wood-work creaked, and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped several times, and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the sound of his own footsteps.

When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner. They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting, and put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.

He sat down, and began to think. Every year--every month, almost--men were strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth.

Evidence? What evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.

Paris! Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had gone, by the midnight train, as he had intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months before any suspicions would be aroused. Months? Everything could be destroyed long before then.

A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat, and went out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman outside on the pavement, and seeing the flash of the lantern reflected in the window. He waited, holding his breath.

After a few moments he opened the front door, and slipped out, shutting it very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In about ten minutes his valet appeared, half dressed, and looking very drowsy.

"I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis," he said, stepping in; "but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?"

"Five minutes past two, sir," answered the man, looking at the clock and yawning.

"Five minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine to-morrow. I have some work to do."

"All right, sir."

"Did any one call this evening?"

"Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away to catch his train."

"Oh! I am sorry I didn't see him. Did he leave any message?"

"No, sir, except that he would write to you."

[86] "That will do, Francis. Don't forget to call me at nine tomorrow."

"No, sir."

The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.

Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the yellow marble table, and passed into the library. He walked up and down the room for a quarter of an hour, biting his lip, and thinking. Then he took the Blue Book down from one of the shelves, and began to turn over the leaves. "Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair." Yes; that was the man he wanted.




CHAPTER XII

[...86] At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray, and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.

The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he had been having some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all. His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.

He turned round, and, leaning on his elbow, began to drink his chocolate. The mellow November sun was streaming into the room. The sky was bright blue, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost like a morning in May.

Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent blood-stained feet into his brain, and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward, that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair, came back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.

He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.

He passed his hand across his forehead, and then got up hastily, and dressed himself with even more than his usual attention, giving a good deal of care to the selection of his necktie and scarf-pin, and changing his rings more than once.

He spent a long time over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of [87] getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. Over some of the letters he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times over, and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face. "That awful thing, a woman's memory!" as Lord Henry had once said.

When he had drunk his coffee, he sat down at the table, and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.

"Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address."

As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette, and began sketching upon a piece of paper, drawing flowers, and bits of architecture, first, and then faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have an extraordinary likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and, getting up, went over to the bookcase and took out a volume at hazard. He was determined that he would not think about what had happened, till it became absolutely necessary to do so.

When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page of the book. It was Gautier's "Emaux et Camées," Charpentier's Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of citron-green leather with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted pomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he turned over the pages his eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand "du supplice encore mal lavée," with its downy red hairs and its "doigts de faune." He glanced at his own white taper fingers, and passed on, till he came to those lovely verses upon Venice:

Sur une gamme chromatique,
    Le sein de perles ruisselant,
La Vénus de l'Adriatique
    Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc.
Les dômes, sur l'azur des ondes
    Suivant la phrase au pur contour,
S'enflent comme des gorges rondes
    Que soulève un soupir d'amour.
L'esquif aborde et me dépose,
    Jetant son amarre au pilier,
Devant une façade rose,
    Sur le marbre d'un escalier.
How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, lying in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of color reminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall honey-combed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself,--

Devant une façade rose,
Sur le marbre d'un escalier.
[88] The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to delightful fantastic follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor Basil! what a horrible way for a man to die!

He sighed, and took up the book again, and tried to forget. He read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little café at Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile, and longs to be back by the hot lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles, with small beryl eyes, that crawl over the green steaming mud; and of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the "monstre charmant" that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre. But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be out of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital importance.

They had been great friends once, five years before,--almost inseparable, indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never did.

He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the Laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science tripos of his year. Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own, in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray together,--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished, and indeed exercised often without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire's the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen together at the Opera, and wherever good music was going on. For eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when [89] they met, and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too,--was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music of any passionate character, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in some of the scientific reviews, in connection with certain curious experiments.

This was the man that Dorian Gray was waiting for, pacing up and down the room, glancing every moment at the clock, and becoming horribly agitated as the minutes went by. At last the door opened, and his servant entered.

"Mr. Alan Campbell, sir."

A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the color came back to his cheeks.

"Ask him to come in at once, Francis."

The man bowed, and retired. In a few moments Alan Campbell walked in, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.

"Alan! this is kind of you. I thank you for coming."

"I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it was a matter of life and death." His voice was hard and cold. He spoke with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and appeared not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted.

"It is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one person. Sit down."

Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The two men's eyes met. In Dorian's there was infinite pity. He knew that what he was going to do was dreadful.

After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of the man he had sent for, "Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table. He has been dead ten hours now. Don't stir, and don't look at me like that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern you. What you have to do is this--"

"Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything further. Whether what you have told me is true or not true, doesn't concern me. I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself. They don't interest me any more."

"Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can't help myself. You are the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the matter. I have no option. Alan, you are a scientist. You know about chemistry, and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you have got to do is to destroy the [90] thing that is up-stairs,--to destroy it so that not a vestige will be left of it. Nobody saw this person come into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air."

"You are mad, Dorian."

"Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian."

"You are mad, I tell you,--mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil's work you are up to?"

"It was a suicide, Alan."

"I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy."

"Do you still refuse to do this, for me?"

"Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I don't care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have thought you knew more about people's characters. Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don't come to me."

"Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don't know what he had made me suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the result was the same."

"Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, you are certain to be arrested, without my stirring in the matter. Nobody ever commits a murder without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it."

"All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there don't affect you. If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I want you to do is simply what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy a body must be less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me."

[91] "I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me."

"Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you came I almost fainted with terror. No! don't think of that. Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view. You don't inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from. Don't inquire now. I have told you too much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once, Alan."

"Don't speak about those days, Dorian: they are dead."

"The dead linger sometimes. The man up-stairs will not go away. He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan! if you don't come to my assistance I am ruined. Why, they will hang me, Alan! Don't you understand? They will hang me for what I have done."

"There is no good in prolonging this scene. I refuse absolutely to do anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me."

"You refuse absolutely?"

"Yes."

The same look of pity came into Dorian's eyes, then he stretched out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table. Having done this, he got up, and went over to the window.

Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale, and he fell back in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.

After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round, and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.

"I am so sorry, Alan," he murmured, "but you leave me no alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the address. If you don't help me, I must send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you. You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh, offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me,--no living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate terms."

Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.

"Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it."

A groan broke from Campbell's lips, and he shivered all over. The ticking of the clock on the mantel-piece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead, and as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead. It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him.

"Come, Alan, you must decide at once."

[92] He hesitated a moment. "Is there a fire in the room up-stairs?" he murmured.

"Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos."

"I will have to go home and get some things from the laboratory."

"No, Alan, you need not leave the house. Write on a sheet of note-paper what you want, and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you."

Campbell wrote a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then he rang the bell, and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as soon as possible, and to bring the things with him.

When the hall door shut, Campbell started, and, having got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a sort of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.

As the chime struck one, Campbell turned around, and, looking at Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him. "You are infamous, absolutely infamous!" he muttered.

"Hush, Alan: you have saved my life," said Dorian.

"Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In doing what I am going to do, what you force me to do, it is not of your life that I am thinking."

"Ah, Alan," murmured Dorian, with a sigh, "I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you." He turned away, as he spoke, and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.

After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered, carrying a mahogany chest of chemicals, with a small electric battery set on top of it. He placed it on the table, and went out again, returning with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously-shaped iron clamps.

"Shall I leave the things here, sir?" he asked Campbell.

"Yes," said Dorian. "And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids?"

"Harden, sir."

"Yes,--Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered, and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don't want any white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty place, otherwise I wouldn't bother you about it."

"No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?"

Dorian looked at Campbell. "How long will your experiment take, Alan?" he said, in a calm, indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.

Campbell frowned, and bit his lip. "It will take about five hours," he answered.

[93] "It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven, Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want you."

"Thank you, sir," said the man, leaving the room.

"Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is! I'll take it for you. You bring the other things." He spoke rapidly, and in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left the room together.

When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his eyes. He shuddered. "I don't think I can go in, Alan," he murmured.

"It is nothing to me. I don't require you," said Campbell, coldly.

Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of the portrait grinning in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before, for the first time in his life, he had forgotten to hide it, when he crept out of the room.

But what was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible it was!--more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.

He opened the door a little wider, and walked quickly in, with half-closed eyes and averted head, determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down, and taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it over the picture.

He stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had thought of each other.

"Leave me now," said Campbell.

He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and was sitting up in it, with Campbell gazing into the glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs he heard the key being turned in the lock.

It was long after seven o'clock when Campbell came back into the library. He was pale, but absolutely calm. "I have done what you asked me to do," he muttered. "And now, good-by. Let us never see each other again."

"You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that," said Dorian, simply.

As soon as Campbell had left, he went up-stairs. There was a horrible smell of chemicals in the room. But the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone.




CHAPTER XIII

[94] "There is no good telling me you are going to be good, Dorian," cried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled with rose-water. "You are quite perfect. Pray don't change."

Dorian shook his head. "No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good actions yesterday."

"Where were you yesterday?"

"In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself."

"My dear boy," said Lord Henry smiling, "anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people who live out of town are so uncivilized. There are only two ways, as you know, of becoming civilized. One is by being cultured, the other is by being corrupt. Country-people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate."

"Culture and corruption," murmured Dorian. "I have known something of both. It seems to me curious now that they should ever be found together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I have altered."

"You have not told me yet what your good action was. Or did you say you had done more than one?"

"I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else. I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She was quite beautiful, and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don't you? How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her as flower-like as I had found her."

"I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure, Dorian," interrupted Lord Henry. "But I can finish your idyl for you. You gave her good advice, and broke her heart. That was the beginning of your reformation."

"Harry, you are horrible! You mustn't say these dreadful things. Hetty's heart is not broken. Of course she cried, and all that. But there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her garden."

"And weep over a faithless Florizel," said Lord Henry, laughing. "My dear Dorian, you have the most curious boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really contented now with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, having met you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will be wretched. From a moral point of view I really don't think much of your great renunciation. [95] Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the present moment in some mill-pond, with water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?"

"I can't bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don't care what you say to me, I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window, like a spray of jasmine. Don't let me talk about it any more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me something about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to the club for days."

"The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance."

"I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time," said Dorian, pouring himself out some wine, and frowning slightly.

"My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and the public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case, and Alan Campbell's suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist. Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the gray ulster who left Victoria by the midnight train on the 7th of November was poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we will be told that he has been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world."

"What do you think has happened to Basil?" asked Dorian, holding up his Burgundy against the light, and wondering how it was that he could discuss the matter so calmly.

"I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is no business of mine. If he is dead, I don't want to think about him. Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it. One can survive everything nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her."

Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and, passing into the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped, and, looking over at Lord Henry, said, "Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?"

Lord Henry yawned. "Basil had no enemies, and always wore a Waterbury watch. Why should he be murdered? He was not clever enough to have enemies. Of course he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was really rather dull. He only interested me once, [96] and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you."

"I was very fond of Basil," said Dorian, with a sad look in his eyes. "But don't people say that he was murdered?"

"Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to be probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his chief defect. Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and bald, and yellow. You are really wonderful, Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people whose opinions I listen to now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her last wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that thing you are playing is! I wonder did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the villa, and the salt spray dashing against the panes? It is marvelously romantic. What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don't stop. I want music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo, and that I am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity. Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. But it has all been to you no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are still the same.

"I wonder what the rest of your life will be. Don't spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type. Don't make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don't deceive yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly-built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe, and think yourself strong. But a chance tone of color in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings strange memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play,--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our [97] own senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odor of heliotrope passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest year of my life over again.

"I wish I could change places with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days have been your sonnets."

Dorian rose up from the piano, and passed his hand through his hair. "Yes, life has been exquisite," he murmured, "but I am not going to have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant things to me. You don't know everything about me. I think that if you did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don't laugh."

"Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and play the nocturne over again. Look at that great honey-colored moon that hangs in the dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she will come closer to the earth. You won't? Let us go to the club, then. It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is some one at the club who wants immensely to know you,--young Lord Poole, Bournmouth's eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful, and rather reminds me of you."

"I hope not," said Dorian, with a touch of pathos in his voice. "But I am tired to-night, Harry. I won't go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I want to go to bed early."

"Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than I had ever heard from it before."

"It is because I am going to be good," he answered, smiling. "I am a little changed already."

"Don't change, Dorian; at any rate, don't change to me. We must always be friends."

"Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm."

"My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be going about warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we are, and will be what we will be. Come round tomorrow. I am going to ride at eleven, and we might go together. The Park is quite lovely now. I don't think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you."

"Very well. I will be here at eleven," said Dorian. "Good-night, Harry." As he reached the door he hesitated for a moment, as if he had something more to say. Then he sighed and went out.

It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm, and did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled [98] home, smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He heard one of them whisper to the other, "That is Dorian Gray." He remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was. He had told the girl whom he had made love him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him, and told him that wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she had!--just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.

When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.

Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing for the unstained purity of his boyhood,--his rose-white boyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption, and given horror to his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own it had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame. But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?

It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away. It was already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell, his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was nothing to him.

A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for. Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.

As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had already gone away. He would go and look.

He took the lamp from the table and crept up-stairs. As he unlocked the door, a smile of joy flitted across his young face and [99] lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.

He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and indignation broke from him. He could see no change, unless that in the eyes there was a look of cunning, and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome,--more loathsome, if possible, than before,--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilt.

Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the desire of a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these?

Why was the red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing had dripped,--blood even on the hand that had not held the knife.

Confess? Did it mean that he was to confess? To give himself up, and be put to death? He laughed. He felt that the idea was monstrous. Besides, who would believe him, even if he did confess? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere. Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say he was mad. They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.

Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement. There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty Merton.

It was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At least he thought so. But who could tell?

And this murder,--was it to dog him all his life? Was he never to get rid of the past? Was he really to confess? No. There was only one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself,--that was evidence.

He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? It had given him pleasure once to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon it. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it had been conscience. He would destroy it.

He looked round, and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it [100] would kill the painter's work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past, and when that was dead he would be free. He seized it, and stabbed the canvas with it, ripping the thing right up from top to bottom.

There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke, and crept out of their rooms. Two gentlemen, who were passing in the Square below, stopped, and looked up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman, and brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no answer. The house was all dark, except for a light in one of the top windows. After a time, he went away, and stood in the portico of the next house and watched.

"Whose house is that, constable?" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.

"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir," answered the policeman.

They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.

Inside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying, and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.

After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the footmen and crept up-stairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force the door, they got on the roof, and dropped down on to the balcony. The windows yielded easily: the bolts were old.

When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was.
